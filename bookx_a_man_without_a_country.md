### 2 Do you know what a twerp is?

Democracy in America

But I have to say this in defense of humankind: In no matter what era in history, including the Garden of Eden, everybody just got here. And, except for the Garden of Eden, there were already all these games going on that could make you act crazy, even if you weren’t crazy to begin with

Most of our critics are products of English departments and are very suspicious of anyone who takes an interest in technology

I think that novels that leave out technology misrepresent life as badly as Victorians misrepresented life by leaving out sex.

### 3 Here is a lesson in creative writing

The truth is, we know so little about life, we don’t really know what the good news is and what the bad news is.

And if I die—God forbid—I would like to go to heaven to ask somebody in charge up there, “Hey, what was the good news and what was the bad news?

### 5 Okay, now let’s have some fun

A few Americans, but very few, still have extended families. The Navahos. The Kennedys.
But most of us, if we get married nowadays, are just one more person for the other person. The groom gets one more pal, but it’s a woman. The woman gets one more person to talk to about everything, but it’s a man.
When a couple has an argument nowadays, they may think it’s about money or power or sex or how to raise the kids or whatever. What they’re really saying to each other, though without realizing it, is this: “You are not enough people!”
A husband, a wife and some kids is not a family. It’s a terribly vulnerable survival unit.

we are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is.”

Human beings are chimpanzees who get crazy drunk on power

### 9 Do unto others

For some reason, the most vocal Christians among us never mention the Beatitudes

### 11 Now then, I have some good news

The good Earth—we could have saved it, but we were too damn cheap and lazy.”

### 12 I used to be the owner and manager of an automobile dealership

Humor is a way of holding off how awful life can be, to protect yourself. Finally, you get just too tired, and the news is too awful, and humor doesn’t work anymore

his principal complaint about other human beings was that they so seldom noticed it when they were happy
