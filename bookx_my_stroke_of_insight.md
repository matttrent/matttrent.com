# My Stroke of Insight A Brain Scientists Personal Journey

By Jill Bolte Taylor

## My notes <a name="my_notes_dont_delete"></a>

#### Hempispheric asymmetries

I knew the 2 halves of my brain are different.  However, I did not think how this interlay works in creating the perception I experience.  A few things she mentioned really stood out from my experience:

- The left brain organizes moments into linear configuration.  From that arises the concept of time and past, present and future.  I didn't complete lose my perception of time, but I definite had difficulty with durations and ordering of events.  I generally knew A, B and C happened.  But I couldn't really recall the orders of them
- The right brain organizes details of any moment.  Other times I could remember the ordering of events, but only the vaguest sense of the details of each experience.  Like Mom's retirement party, I knew certain things happened, and could order them in time.  But I forgot all specific details of each episode.
- The left side of the brain is constantly talking to itself.  One major job of the that language center is to contiually remind the self who it is by saying "I am".  As the language center gets interrupted, that voice speaks less and less and without being continually reminded you start to forgot who you are.  Or perhaps start to lose yourself.  The self seems to be an active construct separate from merely the memory.

She talked about restoring her memory in terms of conceptual recall.  She had to learn what things were again.  I didn't have as much trouble with that.  However, my experiential memory has fared far worse.

### Morning of the stroke

She mentioned feeling truly at one with her body.  I felt the opposite much of the time, as if I was pulled back from my body along some additional dimension besides the normal spacial 3.  I ceased to wear my body as a glove and face as a mask.  I was pulled back forced to interact with the world from a "distance", through a tunnel of fuzzy vision, marionetting a body that I only sensed through the tenuous tug of the strings.

### Orchestrating my rescue

I also vascillated between moments of being able to think clearly and the lack of ability to.  It especially caught me off guard with my speech.  My internal thinking was fragmented, but I was generally able to assemble cohorent sentences.  Often better than I was able to verbally articulate.  One of the most frightening experiences is thinking I've be making sense while speaking and suddenly realize I haven't.  It was really scary to suddenly realize how fucked up you are and that you'd completely forgotten or not noticed.

### Neurological intensive care

The ability to lose pieces of ourselves one program at a time.  I experienced similar, but in a slightly different vein.  As I think I wrote somewhere previously, Jill Taylor experienced a total blackout of part of her neural network.  On the other hand, I experienced rolling brownouts.  Her's were total loss but once she stabilized, my impression is that she had a relatively stable set of brain functions she could rely on and adapt to that.

My set of available cognitive abilities shifted hour to hour and I had to constantly reorient myself in a changing internal landscape, assess my cognitive functions and execute a plan with what was available.

### Day two: the morning after

Social living is in large part responding favorably to other people's demands on you.  when you're literally not able to, it's kind of amazing how people change. We mostly interact because we want something.

Could I rejoin the ratrace without becoming a rat again. Personally I bottled everything back up in my ego-narrator for survival purposes.  Can I unbundle it again when I feel safe again?  Cleave off parts of my psyche that don't serve me?

### Healing and preparing for surgery

Her mention of being shocked that she couldn't perceive color until her left hemisphere needed to be told about it before it registered.  What else is like that?  What else is right in front of us that we can't perceive because we don't have appropriate conceptual labels for it?  Perception is mostly a labeling problem.  If we don't have a term to call it by, it almost doesn't exist.

### What I needed the most

I've been granted the opportunity to step away from my self, view it in a different light, then step back and choose to wear it again.  I should not be encumbered by what I did before.  I should explore every curiosity that passes my way.  	I need to be as supportive as possible of this new person I might become.

I had to define my priorities for what I wanted to get back the most and not waste energy on other things.

Her recovery was so dependent on the support she got from others.  I felt I received so little.  People didn't understand what happened.  I didn't understand what happened.  I couldn't communicate it.  Sigh.

On the other hand, I now know I have the capacity to deal with near death of self and bring myself back.  Most people don't have those stores within them.

### Milestones for recovery

Similarly, as I've regained more parts of my self, I've reacquired much of the BS in me as well.  I regret having to so hastily stitch myself back together to deal with the pressures of life, and wish I had more time to intentionally pick which pieces I drew back in and not.  I truly hope I'm able to sort through and separate some pieces before the sense of self fully cements itself again.

### My right and left mind

I really identified with both of the major concepts in this chapter: attention and the left-side chatter.

I fully believe that you will find whatever you go looking for. The world is too big and messy for you to passively take it all in. Perception is an active process, discarding whatever it doesn't see a need for. You have to be very careful about your beliefs about the world because your perception **will** reinforce them.

I really thought a lot about the narrator my experience.  I think it's a much more apt description than the ego.  Or maybe that term is too loaded. Much of my experience was the narrator attempting to keep a running thread of what was happening and construct a unified concept of time and identify of self.  It partly failed at both.  It kept trying to weave a coherent story of what was happening in the world, and what was happening in my head and what was happening to me.  While it made it through, it stumbled pretty substantially along the way.

The narrator.  I can't believe how similar that is to her left brain self chattering, and she eventually does describe the narrator.  However, I perceived it as the narrator being unable to keep the plot as the shifting pieces around it.  I think I more identified with the narrator, assuming its ability was intact.  In her case, she realized that the narrator was a program, equally prone to failure as any other portion of her mind.  I think that's a very subtle and important insight.  Upon introspection, I feel her viewpoint is probably more correct.

I experience long gaps without internal chatter.  Once I stopped freaking out about them, I grew to really cherish them.  It was some of the closest I've come to no-mind mentioned in meditation.  I lost the ability to perceive outside the current moment and could only observe what was around me.  It was pretty amazing while it lasted.  At other times I was disassociated enough that while the narrator.

### Cells and multidimensional circuitry

I also really like her ideas of how to turn her left-side chatter away from poor mental loops.  Particularly #1.  Curiosity is always something I have to engage.  If I'm cranky, I occasionally don't feel like reading that much, but I can certainly write my opinions on things.  Even if all I do is start ranting, I can usually gather steam and push the topic in a more productive direction.

1. I remember something I find fascinating that I would like to ponder more deeply
2. I think about something that brings me terrific joy
3. I think about something I would like to do

### Other thoughts

Why didn't I do this earlier?  Frankly, had bigger battles to wage.  Lots of other things going on competing for my time and attention.  Also, conceptualizing most of this and converting it into linear language is both slow and congnitively taxing.  I haven't had the mental space available to do so.

What is the self?  I look back on the last 6 months and much of that time doesn't necessarily feel like it was me that experienced it.  But someone else?  Who is that person and where did they go?  The memories seem colored differently.  I've lost a lot of memories from that time, but feel more like me, whoever that is.  If the job of that voice is to remind me of who I am, is my experience of self mostly a matter of it rehashing memories to me, where is it getting them from?  Who am I if I'm not my memories.

For any two of us to communicate with one another, we must share a certain amount of common reality.

By the time a message reaches our cerebral cortex for higher thinking, we have already placed a "feeling" upon how we view that stimulation - is this pain or is this pleasure? Although many of us may think of ourselves as thinking creatures that feel, biologically we are feeling creatures that think.

Thanks to the skills of our right mind, we are capable of remembering isolated moments with uncanny clarity and accuracy.

To the right mind, no time exists other than the present moment, and each moment is vibrant with sensation.

By organizing details in a linear and methodical configuration, our left brain manifests the concept of time whereby our moments are divided into the past, present, and future.

Our left hemisphere language centers use words to describe, define, categorize, and communicate about everything.

Via our left hemisphere language centers, our mind speaks to us constantly, a phenomenon I refer to as "brain chatter."

One of the jobs of our left hemisphere language centers is to define our self by saying "I am."

our left hemisphere categorizes information into hierarchies including things that attract us (our likes) or repel us (our dislikes). It places the judgment of good on those things we like and bad on those things we dislike.

Feeling detached from normal reality, I seemed to be witnessing my activity as opposed to feeling like the active participant performing the action. 

I felt bizarre, as if my conscious mind was suspended somewhere between my normal reality and some esoteric space.

my verbal thoughts were now inconsistent, fragmented, and interrupted by an intermittent silence.

As my brain chatter began to disintegrate, I felt an odd sense of isolation.

As the language centers in my left hemisphere grew increasingly silent and I became detached from the memories of my life

Those little voices, that brain chatter that customarily kept me abreast of myself in relation to the world outside of me, were delightfully silent. And in their absence, my

Morning of the Stroke

memories of the past and my dreams of the future evaporated. I was alone. In the moment, I was alone with nothing but the rhythmic pulse of my beating heart.

I welcomed the reprieve that the silence brought from the constant chatter that related me to what I now perceived as the insignificant affairs of society.

Remember, please remember everything you are experiencing!

But getting help was challenging because I found it almost impossible to concentrate or keep my mind on task. I caught myself chasing random thoughts as they danced in and out of my brain, and sadly, I was fully aware that I was inept at holding a plan in my mind long enough to execute it.

it was as if all the drawers had been slammed shut and the cabinets pushed just beyond my reach.

in the absence of my cognitive pictures and expansive ideas, time escaped me. The memories from my past were no longer available for recollection, leaving me cloaked from the bigger picture of who I was and what I was doing here as a life form.

I vacillated between moments of being able to think clearly (I call these "waves of clarity"), and the lack of ability to think at all.

Time stood still because that clock that would sit and tick in the back of my left brain, that clock that helped me establish linearity between my thoughts, was now silent

calculations, by definition, requires recognition of the relationship between different entities, and my mind was no longer capable of creating combinations.

But keeping my mind tuned in to what I was trying to do was like struggling to hang on to a slippery fish.

 was shocked, however, when I did realize that I could not speak intelligibly. Even though I could hear myself speak clearly within my mind,

Who am I? What am I doing? 

My consciousness no longer retained the discriminatory functions of my dominant analytical left brain. Without those inhibiting thoughts, I had stepped beyond my perception of myself as an individual. 

A consciousness that was different from the one I had known before, however, because my left hemisphere had been packed with details about how to make sense of the external world.

it was clear that the "I" whom I had grown up to be had not survived this neurological catastrophe. I understood that that Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor died that morning, and yet, with that said, who was left?

Without a language center telling me: "I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor. I am a neuroanatomist. I live at this address and can be reached at this phone number," I felt no obligation to being her anymore.

I had forgotten about my job and all the things in my life that brought me stress - and with this obliteration of memories, I felt both relief and joy. I had spent a lifetime of 37 years being enthusiastically committed to "do-do-doing" lots of stuff at a very fast pace.

Although one set of programs was no longer functioning - the one that reminded me moment by moment of who I was and where I lived, etc., the other parts of me remained alert and continued processing instantaneous information.

The most notable difference between my pre- and post-stroke cognitive experience was the dramatic silence that had taken up residency inside my head.

When using pictures to navigate my way back into language, it was impossible to go from a general file to a specific detail.

I intellectually conceptualized my body as a compilation of various neurological programs, but it wasn't until this experience with stroke that I really understood that we all have the ability to lose pieces of ourselves one program at a time.

Those little voices inside your head, reminding you of who you are and where you live, become silent. You lose memory connection to your old emotional self

The professionals who did not connect with me sapped my energy, so I protected myself by ignoring their requests.

Honestly, there were certain aspects of my new existence that I preferred over the way I had been before.

"Could I rejoin the rat race without becoming a rat again?"

 struggled with finding the right word and frequently confused meanings. I remember thinking water but saying milk.

Cognitively, I struggled to comprehend my existence. I still couldn't think in terms of past or future so I burned a lot of mental energy trying to piece together my present moment.

although certain portions of my mind could not function, other parts of my brain, in this case my scheming mind, would compensate for lost abilities.

If the boundary between what you can do and what you cannot do is not clearly defined, then you don't know what to try next. Recovery can be derailed by hopelessness.

My energy reserve did not discriminate between cognitive versus physical activity.

It still blows my mind (so to speak) that I could not see color until I was told that color was a tool I could use. Who would have guessed that my left hemisphere needed to be told about color in order for it to register?

There seemed to be a serious gap in my information processing and often I could not articulate what I was thinking. Although I would think that I wanted a glass of water, and picture a glass of water in my mind, the word "milk" would still come out of my mouth.

be: peace is only a thought away, and all we have to do to access it is silence the voice of our dominating left mind.

I cannot stress enough the value of getting plenty of sleep. I truly believe that the brain is the ultimate authority on what it needs to heal itself.

if I didn't respect my brain's need for sleep, my sensory systems experienced agonizing pain and I became psychologically and physically depleted.

it was vitally important that my caregivers permit me the freedom to let go of my past accomplishments so I could identify new areas of interest.

it was essential that we challenge my brain systems immediately. Connections in my brain had been broken and it was crucial that we re-stimulate them before they either died or completely forgot how to do what they were designed to do.

I had to define my priorities for what I wanted to get back the most and not waste energy on other things.

The more I recovered my old files, the more my old emotional baggage surfaced, and the more I needed to evaluate the usefulness of preserving its underlying neural circuitry.

I have been very fussy this time around about which emotional programs I am interested in retaining and which ones I have no interest in giving voice to again (impatience, criticism, unkindness). What a wonderful gift this stroke has been in permitting me to pick and choose who and how I want to be in the world. Before the stroke, I believed I was a product of this brain and that I had minimal say about how I felt or what I thought. Since the hemorrhage, my eyes have been opened to how much choice I actually have about what goes on between my ears.

Lots of people looked at me as if I was odd, but having lost my left hemisphere ego center, I wasn't concerned with their approval or disapproval.

I worked with a Gestalt therapist who helped me verbalize my right hemisphere experience of that morning.

there were personality traits that tried to rise from the ashes of my left mind that, quite frankly, were no longer acceptable to my right hemispheric sense of who I now wanted to be.

would it be possible for me to recover my perception of my self, where I exist as a single, solid, separate from the whole, without recovering the cells associated with my egotism, intense desire to be argumentative, need to be right, or fear of separation and death?

a decrease in the activity of the left hemisphere language centers resulting in a silencing of their brain chatter. 

In addition, our minds are highly sophisticated "seek and ye shall find" instruments. We are designed to focus in on whatever we are looking for.

One of the most prominent characteristics of our left brain is its ability to weave stories. This story-teller portion of our left mind's language center is specifically designed to make sense of the world outside of us, based upon minimal amounts of information. It functions by taking whatever details it has to work with, and then weaves them together in the form of a story. Most impressively, our left brain is brilliant in its ability to make stuff up, and fill in the blanks when there are gaps in its factual data.

until I realized that my left mind full-heartedly expected the rest of my brain to believe the stories it was making up!

I need to be very wary of my storyteller's potential for stirring up drama and trauma.

In the same vein, as my left brain enthusiastically manufactured stories that it promoted as the truth, it had a tendency to be redundant - manifesting loops of thought patterns that reverberated through my mind, over and over again.

The portion of my left mind that I chose not to recover was the part of my left hemisphere character that had the potential to be mean, worry incessantly, or be verbally abusive to either myself or others. Frankly, I just didn't like the way these attitudes felt physiologically inside my body.

I often wonder, in the absence of language or the ability to communicate with others in a normal way, what insights or abilities has that person gained?

Now that my left mind's language centers and storyteller are back to functioning normally, I find my mind not only spins a wild tale but has a tendency to hook into negative patterns of thought.

When I become conscious of what cognitive loops my brain is running, I then focus on how these loops feel physiologically inside my body. 

paying attention to our selftalk is vitally important for our mental health.

 To counter their activities, I keep a handy list of three things available for me to turn my consciousness toward when I am in a state of need: 1) I remember something I find fascinating that I would like to ponder more deeply, 2) I think about something that brings me terrific joy, or 3) I think about something I would like to do.
