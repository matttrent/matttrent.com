# Whole Earth Discipline

The subtitle of the book covers most of it's thesis:

>   Why dense cities, nuclear power, transgenic crops, restored wildlands, and geoengineering are necessary.

Brand makes the claim that climate change is the biggest challenge facing the planet.  He then proceeds to lay out a course of action of why many technological advances, opposed by the traditional green/ecologist agenda, are necessary to avert climate disaster.  He posits both that the downsides of the technologies are less than claimed, and even if they are as bad as heralded it's still likely a better outcome than the alternative.

## scale, scope, stakes, speed

__Brand lays out the severity of the climate change as a justification of the actions will we need to collectively take to address it.__

In the face of climage change, everyone is an environmentalist.  When roles shift, ideologies have to shift, and ideologies hate to shift.

The planet will be fine, it is humans who are in trouble.

Humans perpetually fight, because they're always outstripping the carrying capacity of their natural environment and then have to fight over resources.  Civilized sophistication could collapse if carrying capacities everywhere are lowered by severe climate change.  Humanity would revert to its norm of constant battles for diminishing resources.

There are lots of opportunities for bad positive feedback with climate change.  Less ice means lower surface albedo.  Melting tundra means more atmospheric methane.  Higher sea temperatures could release trillions of tons more methane and flip the oceans from carbon sink to carbon source.  There is some negative feedback, the world's land areas are absorbing more carbon dioxide than they're releasing.  But the whole system is chaotic as most of the earth's climate history has been and our climate models don't know the transition points.  Changes in the gulf stream appear to have triggered severe climate changes 12,000 years ago that occurred not over decades but in 1-3 years.

Warmer temperatures are moving north 25 miles a decade, whereas animals and plans are moving north at only 3.75 miles per decade.  Significant issue for species' adaptability.

3 strategies for dealing with climate change are:

- mitigation, avoiding the unmanagable (cut back on co2)
- adaptation, managing the unavoidable (move costal populations)
- amelioration, adjusting the nature of the planet itself (geoengineer)

The world currently runs on about 16 terawatts (trillion watts) of energy, most of it burning fossil fuels. To level off at 450 ppm of carbon dioxide, we will have to reduce the fossil fuel burning to 3 terawatts and produce all the rest with renewable energy, and we have to do it in 25 years or it’s too late. Currently about half a terawatt comes from clean hydropower and one terawatt from clean nuclear. That leaves 11.5 terawatts to generate from new clean sources.

Two terawatts of photovoltaic would require installing 100 square meters of 15-percent-efficient solar cells every second, second after second, for the next 25 years. (That’s about 1,200 square miles of solar cells a year, times 25 equals 30,000 square miles of photovoltaic cells.) Two terawatts of solar thermal? If it’s 30 percent efficient all told, we’ll need 50 square meters of highly reflective mirrors every second. (Some 600 square miles a year, times 25.) Half a terawatt of biofuels? Something like one Olympic swimming pools of genetically engineered algae, installed every second. (About 15,250 square miles a year, times 25.) Two terawatts of wind? That’s a 300-foot-diameter wind turbine every 5 minutes. (Install 105,000 turbines a year in good wind locations, times 25.) Two terawatts of geothermal? Build 3 100-megawatt steam turbines every day-1,095 a year, times 25. Three terawatts of new nuclear? That’s a 3-reactor, 3-gigawatt plant every week-52 a year, times 25.

In other words, the land area dedicated to renewable energy (”Renewistan”) would occupy a space about the size of Australia to keep the carbon dioxide level at 450 ppm. To get to Hanson’s goal of 350 ppm of carbon dioxide, fossil fuel burning would have to be cut to ZERO, which means another 3 terawatts would have to come from renewables, expanding the size of Renewistan further by 26 percent.

Industrially, humanity has the collective capacity. But politically, I don't see how.

Although humans have been building infrastructure for thousands of years, it's still an intellectual no-man's-land.

The standard post-glacier steep drop in methane suddenly reversed 5000 years ago and headed up, due to our rice farming, methane-burping livestock, and forest-burning for agriculture.  Dips in atmospheric CO2 in 200-600, 1300-1400 and 1500-1750 all correspond to major human die-offs from disease.

"The end of nature," to use Bill McKibben's famous book title didn't begin 200 years ago with the industrial revolution but 10,000 years ago with the agricultural revolution.  "Farming is not nature, but rather the largest alteration of Earth's surface from it's natural state humans have yet achieved".  "A good case can be made that the people in the Iron Age and even the late Stone Age had a much greater per-capita impact on the earth's landscape than the average modern-day person".

How do you build good judgement? (Experience!) How do you build experience? (Bad judgement!)

__We are forced to enter an era of large-scale ecosystem engineering, and we have to know what the hell we're doing.  We are as gods and HAVE to get good at it.__

## city planet

__Brand advocates that people move to denser cities, concentrating humanity in cities requires a lower investment per capita to provide services.__

Many people regard subsistence farming as soulful and organic, but it's a poverty trap and an environmental disaster.

Cities are so much more successful in promoting new forms of income generation, and it is so much cheaper to provide services in urban areas. 80-90% of GNP growth occurs in cities.  The half of the world's population living in cities occupies only 2.8% of the world's land area.  Cities increase their creativity with increasing size, but the relation is superlinear.

Most farming innovations, for example, are city-based.  Use of fodder crops like alfalfa to fix nitrogen in the soil was developed first in city gardens.

55 times more tropical rain forest is growing back each year than is being cut.

Discomfort is an investment.

Squatter cities are improved steadily and gradually, increment of increment, by the people living there.  San Francisco used to be a shantytown.

Treating houses mainly as property tends to destroy community, and any practice that treats them mainly as homes preserves community.  The best plans generally let the slum dwellers themselves make the main decisions in planning their future.

## urban promise

__Beyond being the most efficient and greenest invention of humanity, cities accelerate innovation.  They also discourage population growth, which has advantages on energy consumption, but might also have economic consequences.__

Economic development and social change follow the cell towers wherever they go.

The great monetizer is prepaid SIM cards--a business worth $3 billion across Africa in 2007, run by local entrepreneurs.  Cellphone minutes are traded by phone as a cash substitute. __Alternative currencies__

Connectivity is productivity, whether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village.

The world's slums are the first urban environments to shape themselves around cellphones.  __Primary infrastructure__

Cities encourage lower population.  As more of the world's population moves to urban areas in which children offer little or no economic reward to their parents, and as women acquire economic opportunities and reproductive control, the social and financial costs of childbearing continue to rise.  

Developing nations may get old before they get rich, and that is it's own poverty trap.

Aggregate human impact on natural systems, including the atmosphere, could be going down fast.

Almost half the global population is under the age of 24.  They have an advantage in that they don't have to spend a lot of time _un_learning things that are no longer worth knowing.

The city is the most enviromentally benign form of human settlement.  Each city-deweller consumes less land, less energy, less water, and produces less pollution than his counterpart in settlements of lower densities.  Squatter cities are green, with maximum density and minimum energy and material use.

We need to both protect the newly emptied countryside and Green the hell out of growing cities.  Because cities change constantly anyway, it's not that hard to improve them.

If the 100 largest cities in the world replaced their dark roofs with white shingles and their asphalt-based roads with concrete and other light-colored material, it could offset 44 metric gigatons of greenhouse gases.

"Smart grids" and other microgrids, the distribution of electricity will be reshaped towards greater adaptability as well as efficiency.

Peasant life is over unless catastrophic climate changes drives us back to it.

__If I'm going to be a climate refuge, where am I going to go?__

## new nukes

__Brand proposes that nuclear is essential to meeting climate goals and that it's negatives have been exagerated.  Nuclear power also provides a lens into the challenges of thinking truly long-term.__

One of the greatest dangers the world faces is the possibility that a vocal minority of anti-nuclear activists could prevent phase-out of coal emissions.

How do we think about very long-term problems?

"I would have built the same hole in the ground, for only a couple hundred million, and told everyone that we just wanted to put the waste there for a hundred years while we thought about what to do with it eventually."  Yucca mountain is a classic example of the folly of long-term planning---the illusion that we know now how do to the right thing for the next ten millenia.

We should set in motion events so a process is intensely adaptive, preserving and indeed increasing options as time goes by.

Decisions should be made, taking the "seven generations" approach to future responsibility long attributed to the Iroquois League---a 175-year time frame for thinking about the waste.

Baseload refers to the minimum proven, consistent, around-the-clock, rain-or-shine power that utilities must supply.  Nuclear is the easiest way to provide this.  As for footprint, a nuclear plant producting 1 gigawatt takes up a third of a square mile.

Fly ash and flue gases from coal is the world's largest source of released radioactivity.

_How can I compare the relative pollution from 20 years of coal vs nuclear power per gW?_

Those who know the most are the least frightened?  _but when can perspective be lost and unnecessary faith placed in technology?  we have a history of underestimating technocratic reprocussions.  I'd be interested in hearing Brand's thoughts post-fukushima._

It can be said that the world's worst nuclear power plant disaster is not as destructive to wildlife populations as are normal human activities.

What is the safe/tolerable level of radiation?  People in Ramsar, Iran, live with a background radiation of 13,000 millirems a year with no apparent health consequences.  _but would I?_

The problem isn't that nuclear is expensive.  The problem is coal is cheap.  The perception that renewable energy has been short-changed at the expense of other energy sources is not correct.

Solar works well at the individual level; wind does not.  Wind works well at the institutional level; solar, so far, does not.

The best carbon sequestration technique is to leave the coal in the ground.

Market forces cannot limit greenhouse gases.  Governments have to take the lead.   What they deem the atmosphere requires will be the prime driver of the economics of energy.

And as we promote plug-in cars, we might note that they reduce carbon emissions only if their electricity comes from green sources such as nuclear.

Plan short and option long; take the actions in the near term that preserve the most choices in the long run.

5 out of 6 people live in the developing world.  One way or another, the world's poor will get grid electricity.  Where that electricity comes from will determine what happens with the climate.

## green genes

Brand makes the case for genetically engineer (GE) crops.  Again he claims that beliefs of the potential hazards are overstated and the benefits are under-appreciated, especially the no-till and reduced pesticide aspects.

GE crops may be a necessity for security in developing nations, such as Africa.  Ethical guidelines, such as the precautionary principle of the EU get exported instead of the GE crops.  Developing nations need to be able to decide their own courses of action and work regionally to develop species that work for them.

Homo Sapiens has been meddling with evolution in many ways for a long time.  There is evidence that bacterial species have been swapping DNA amongst themselves for a very long time.

Brand claims that a large-scale controlled experiment has been conducted between the US introducting GE foods and the EU having banned them, with no difference detectable between the treatment and control groups.  _I don't agree with that.  Americans have many more diet-related health issues than Europeans.  While the causes are numerous, I don't think you can rule out GE crops as a part of the problem.  I was going to cite the paper relating GMO crops and celiac disease, but it seems to be disproven._

New GE crops are tested by both the FDA, the department of agriculture and the EPA.  New crops created by breeding go through no such process.

Wheat created through breeding has modifications that include the addition of chromosome fragments, the integrations of entire foreign genomes, and radiation-induced mutations.  Many conventional crops are modified by radiation mutagenesis, where gamma radiation is used to created more variety, causing more disruption to "non-target genes" than occurred in transgenic lines of rice.

Perhaps my issue with GE crops isn't the modification itself but that they encourage monocultures which are less resilient and more succeptible to blight disease and future issues_

Where a gene comes from is irrelevantq the point is what is does.

No product of agriculture is the slightest bit natural to an ecologist.

Glyphosate has no proven effect on any animal--insects, fish, birds, mammals or us. _what is the current status of the WHO IARC designation?_

The great ecological win with GE herbicide-tolerant crops is that they encourage no-till agriculture.  Plowed land is the source of gigatons of CO2 in the atmosphere.  The main ecological effect of Bt crops has been a drastic reduction in pesticide use.  

New glyphosate weeds are turning up, not so much through gene borrowing as through the usual evolutionary response to the increased selection pressure of an highly successful, overemployed, deadly technique.  _so the problem isn't the technique itself, but it's misuse.  that's great to point out, but how do we avoid its misuse?  isn't that basically a given?_

The problem comes when regulatory systems created in rich countries are then exported to regions like Africa.  Most agriculture is developed for the temperate zones.  Most people are in the tropics.  GE [...] is proving to be a tool of regional empowerment, enhancing cultural varieties of foods, and the ability of farmers to seel to global markets without being controlled by them.

Buying new seed every year is the norm in the developed world and is becoming so in the developing world.  _that may be the case, but does it excuse some of the litagory practices Monsanto practices around it?_

Grub first, then ethics.

Wikipedia's success comes from not trying to solve imaginary problems but instead putting all the community's effort into close attention to what actually goes on, noting genuine problems as they emerge, and then solving them as locally as possible with speed and efficiency.  _I'm not sure about this analogy.  Is the risk (likelihood times downside) of things going wrong on wikipedia comparable to that of GE crops?  How do we estimate future damage?_

Shift the bias away from inaction and towards action with supplement.  "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."

## gene dreams

Brand continues his arguements for GE organisms, following from the logic that the bacterial kingom has been doing it for time eternal.  He highly doubts that anything humans engineer is capable of being worse than something nature has already tried and that most of the risks are again overrated.  The ecological and food security benefits of GE organisms far outweigh the downsides.

If green good could thrive in the world, microbes would have invented it long ago.  If we try to create green goo, microbes will defeat it.

It's a transgenic world.  In horizontal transfer "genes can move along a bewildering variety of routes between genomes: sliding through bridges between cellular membranes, hitchhiking inside viruses, or even getting sucked up from the environment as naked fragments."  Horizontally transferred genes can even pass between organisms that are not even of the same specius, genus, sub-kingdom or kingdom of life form.

Suspicion is growing that gene-swapping through viruses is the dominent engine of evolution.

The domestication of biotechnology will dominate our lives during the next 50 years at least as much as the domestication of computers has dominated our lives during the previous 50 years.  __how do I get into this?__

Growing a house.

What are the most environmentally useful things that synthetic biology could do for human food production?  What might a GE-inclusive organic agriculture look like?

It is surprising how the self-appointed experts on agriculture do not know farmers.  _Paging Nassim Taleb._

Governments have appeared almost passive, as if ceding basic responsibilities for the public good to the private sector.  Three-fourths the new biotechnology products are controlled by the private sector.

The first generation--Bt corn and roundup ready foods--focused entirely on farm productivity.  The second generation of GE aims straight at the consumer to provide nutritious, delicious food, free of allergens and toxicity, that anyone can grow.

I want commercial wood grown directly, so beautiful and inexpensive, that cutting down a wild tree for lumber would seem ludicrous.

The poplars in China are a golden opportunity for research on gene flow.  The proof is in the research.  Otherwise we're left with dueling assumptions of no value.

GE aggricultur offers much for climate change.  GE crops need less fertilizer, reducing the nitrous oxide load.  GE bacteria can reduce livestock gas burps.

The best way for doubters to control a questionable new technology is to embrace it, lest it remain wholly in the hands of enthusiasts who think there is nothing questionable about it.

__Where are the Green biotech hackers?__

## romantics, scientists, engineers

The long-egolved Green agenda is suddenly outdated--too negative, too tradition-bound, too specialized, too politically one-sided for the scale fo the climate problem.  Progress used to belong to the progressives, but then it frightened them, and they turned on it.

For Cousteau to disagree with his scientific peers was not a violation of solidarity but part of his job as a scientist.

I would like everybody to become fearless about following science.

Our first duty is to be wary of confirmation bias.  Darwin wrote "that he found it necessary to write down every piece of evidence which appeared to contradict his beliefs because otherwise they would disappear from his mind".

Question convenient fables< listen most closely to the scientists who know the facts best, have studied them the longest, and aren't biosed by an agenda or an employer with an agenda.  _but beware of charlatans_

How resiliant natural systems are and how quickly they bounce back when human pressure backs off even a little bit.

- Nature runs on sunlight
- Nature only uses the energy it needs
- Nature fits form to function
- Nature recycles everything
- Nature rewards cooperation
- Nature banks on diversity
- Nature demands local expertise
- Nature curbs excesses from within
- Nature taps the power of limits

_These all follow from Munger's idea to be able to explain the opposing side's arguments better than they can._

## it's all gardening

Ecosystem engineering is an ancient art, practiced and malpracticed by every human society since the mastery of fire.  We would be fools if we repeat their mistakes and just as foolish if we ignore some of the brilliant practices that worked for them.

We need to preserve and increase the wilderness areas, but the goal is not to isolate them from humans but to involve them in human enterprise in a way beneficial to both wilderness and man.

Maize is arguably man's first, and perhaps his greatest, feat of genetic engineering.  You couldn't get a grant for it because it's too crazy.  You'd get a Nobel prize if your lab didn't get shut down by Greenpeace.

Settling down means inhabiting a place with such close attention that the practices of "tending the wild" and agriculture blur into one.  To protect a wilderness permanently, he insists, it has to be treated not just as a garden but as a commercial garden.

Whale-watching is already employing more people and bringing greater economic benefits than commercial whaling could ever generate.

You cannot protect a wildland just by leaving it alone.  The question is not whether we must manage nature, but rather how shall we manage it--by accident, haphazardly, or with the calculated goal of its survival forever.

You diligently weed and plan and then watch the vegetation do something quite different from what you had in mind.

The threat posed by weeds outweights that from herbicides.  Climate change favors weeds.  Endemic species are often highly specialized to local conditions, with limited range.

We're so ignorant, we don't know how ignorant we are.

Where human populations had stayed in the same place for the greatest duration, feward plans and animals had become endagered species.  Regions of the highest natural diversity have high cultural diversity.

You don't have to be born in a place to be native to it, you just have to engage it long enough and deep enough to belong there.  The point is to build knowledge _about_ where you live in order to better take responsibility _for_ where you live. __Complete The Big Here.__

## planet craft

Humanity is now stuck with a planet steward role.  We are forced to learn planet craft--in both senses of the word: craft as a skill and craft as cunning.

The norm is: We make grand plans, we build stuff, we're mostly glad we did, and the money gets sorted out awkwardly over decades.

When it comes to ecosystem engineering, we are model-rich and data-poor.

Realizations:

- Renewistan will involve stupendous cost, time and disruption
- Mitigation is not going to succeed.  The whirlwind is coming anyway.
- Minds change with events.  Eventually we'll stop calling things anomalies and own up.
- News will continue to get worse.  When one discontinuity in climate happens, a sense of emergency will set in.
- Some forms of geoengineering, expensive as they are, may be a hundred to a thousand times cheaper than building Renewistan, and may have an instantaneous effect.

To turn down the heat we probably have to do something radical to alter what the Earth does with sunlight--dim it or reflect it.

Humanity releases 100 million tons of sulfur dioxide, where the dimming effect keeps earth 2-3 degrees C cooler than if our air were clean.  A lone Greenfinger, working with a small fraction of the Gates bank account could force a lot of geoengineering on his own.

We can also significantly increase the earth's albedo.

Processing biochar is a more reliable method of sequestering carbon than planting trees.

We must get out of the nonsensical all-or-nothing dichotomy that characterizes much current thinking about geoengineering--that we either do it full scale, or we don't do it at all.  

Adopt the mentality of the Internet Engineering Task Force that was require in order to have one universal Internet, and strive for a rough consensus and running code.  The planet's one universal climate requires something similar.  It has to be totally transparent and highly collaborative.  

Seize the century.  We're facing multidecade, multigenerational problems and solutions.  There's so much work to do that it doesn't matter who does it.

Ask yourself:

- What do we want and love?
- What do we know?
- What will we accept?

A project is sustainable if it is cheap enough to be the first of a series continuing indefinitely into the future.  A project is unsustainable if it is so expensive that it cannot be repeated without major political battles.  A sustainable project marks the beginnng of a new era.  An unsustainable project marks the end of an old era.

The best money for pursuing really radical ideas into experimental use comes from individual philanthropists.

## my thoughts

What is the carrying capacity of the earth?  How many humans can we cram on this thing?

I think that answer depends strongly on how we want to live.  With 1 billion people we have a much broader range of solutions than we do with 7 billion.  With 1 billion, we have the option to look much more like the past.  I think that's a very worthwhile consideration, in terms of what we want the world to look like.  There's also what the earth should look like, but that's probably too much of an appeal to any one individual's value system to say much of anything intelligent on.

One consideration to population grow is to reach to ever-higher human populations in this closed system, we need ever-more efficient systems to support them.  As systems become more efficient, they tend to be less resilient, carrying less spare capacity to tolerate faults.  What does this say about large-scale failures in the future?
