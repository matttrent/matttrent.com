# lean startup

## introduction

- startup success is a process, manangement, with guaranteeable results
- learn as quickly as possible, adjust your processes
- accelerate the feedback loop

### start

- new measure of progress: validated learning
- set learning milestones, not product milestones
- cross-functional teams are more productive
- learning is very difficult to quantify -- you often feel like you are being unproductive
- continuous change
    - optimizing product
    - changing strategy (pivot)

### define

- anyone can be an entrepreneur
- any organization can be a startup
- build experimentation systems

### learn

- quantitative targets create the motivation to engage in qualitative inquiry and guide the questions asked
- learn empirically, though experimentation, not focus groups
- is it possible to have discover how flawed your assumptions are without building anything?
- most times customers don't know what they want
- validated learning -- learning is the essential unit of progress in startups
- any effort not tied to learning can be considered waste
- lean startup is not a collection of individual tactics

### experiment

- startup's efforts are an experiment to see which parts of its strategy are brilliant and which are crazy
- experiment follows scientific method
- starts with a clear hypothesis and tests those assumptions empirically

2 major hypotheses:

value hypothesis
:   whether product or service really delivers value to customers

growth hypothesis
:   how new customers discover a product

- experiment isn't a line of inquiry -- it's the first product version

questions to answer:

1. do customers recognize the problem you are trying to solve?
2. if there is a solution, would they buy it?
3. would they buy it from us?
4. can we build a solution for that product?

## steer

- _build-measure-learn_ feedback loop
- we need to focus our energies on minimizing the total time through this feedback look

__biggest challenge is whether development efforts lead to real progress__

### leap

- strategy is based on assumptions
- startups need to test these systematically

_analogies obscure leaps of faith_

genchi gembutsu
:   "go and see for yourself"  

- go, talk to customers, a lot
- all the people you need to talk to exist outside your building

customer archetype
:   basic coarse level of understanding of potential customer and their problems

### test

minimum-viable-product (MVP)
:   version of the product that enables a full turn of the build-measure-learn feedback loop with the minimum amount of effort / development time  

- anwser fundamental business hypotheses in addition to product
- when in doubt, simplify
- any effort beyond what is required to start learning is a waste
- __does not need to be software at all__

concierge MVP
:   personalized service - not the product in itself, but a shortcut to learning that doesn't require product development

wizard of oz testing
:   customers believe they are interacting with actual product, but humans are doing the work behind the scenes

__if we do not know who the customer is, we do not know what quality is__

- customers don't care about complexity, only how much it suits their needs

### measure

innovation accounting
:   prove objectively that you are learning how to grow a sustainable business

3 steps:

1. use MVP to establish where company is right now
2. tune engine from baseline to ideal
3. pivot or persevere

- structure progress around learning milestones
- not product or business development

__good design is one that changes customer behavior for the better__

cohort analysis
:   view each group of customers separately, note differences in behavior

vanity metrics
:   feel-good measures of progress that don't validate/invalidate assumptions and provide no actions

actionable metrics
:   opposite of vanity metrics

kanban

- 4 states of a feature
- backlog, in progress, built, validated
- only 4 features can exist in any state
- forces validation stage to continue feature development

three a's of good metrics

actionable
:   must demonstrate clear cause and effect  
without it, people assume changes were caused by whatever they were working on

accessible
:   make the reports as simple as possible so everyone understands them  
use tangible, concrete units  
reporting infrastructure part of the product itself

auditable
:   need to be able to see how the report was generated  
be able to test the data by hand by talking to customers

### pivot (or persevere)

pivot
:   special kind of change designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, business model, or engine of growth

- the more resources sunk into an idea, the harder to pivot
- cutting resources that slow down the feedback loop don't help
- true measure of runway: how many pivots a startup has left

- meetings should be more than every few weeks and less than every few months

- very actions that made IMVU successful to early adopters were diametrically opposed to the actions required to be succussful with mainstream customers

## accelerate

### batch

- biggest advantage of working in small batches is that quality problems can be identified sooner
- engineers and designers should work side by side on one feature at a time

- from the point of individual efficiency, big batches make more sense
- from the point of group efficiency, small batches are better

work in progress (WIP) inventory
:   development effort (of any kind) that has not yet been used for learning

- startups struggle to see their WIP inventory
- all work gone into an MVP, until that product ships, is WIP inventory
- based on pull requests
- learn startup process is framed by development responding to pull requests spawned by experiments that need to be run

- build-measure-learn
- written in the order it occurs, but should be done backwards
- figure out what you need to learn
- figure out how to measure it
- figure out what needs to be built to do so

### grow

sustainable growth
:   new customers come from the actions of existing customers

__one of the most expensive forms of waste for a startup is spending time arguing about how to prioritize new development__

3 engines of growth

1.  sticky growth
2.  viral growth
3.  paid growth

__successful startups focus on one engine of growth__

### adapt

- you cannot trade quality for time
- causing (or missing) quality problems now will slow you down later
- adaptive processes force you to slow down and invest more time in preventing problems that are currently wasting time

5 whys
:   it takes asking "why" 5 times to get to the root of the problem  
tie investments directly to the prevention of most problematic symptoms

- at the root of every technical problem is a human problem
- ties rate of progress to learning, not just execution
- system to respond quickly to problems as they appear

__there are no failures of people, only of process__

rules for mistakes:

1.  be tolerant of all mistakes the first time
2.  never allow the same mistake to be made twice

### innovate

startups require 3 structural attributes

1. scarce but stable resources
2. independent authority to develop business
3. personal stake in the outcome

- startups must be fully cross-functional

shusa
:   from Toyota, clear leader with authority to build, market and deploy without prior approval

- work done in small batches delivers a clear verdict quickly
- power of feedback
- converge on optimal solutions rapidly even if starting with really bad ideas

__it does not matter how fast we build, but how fast we measure__
