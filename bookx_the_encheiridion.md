# The Encheiridion

Some things are up to us and some are not up to us. Our opinions are up to us, and our impulses, desires, aversions—in short, whatever is our own doing.

__As you aim for such great goals, remember that you must not undertake them by acting moderately,1 but must let some things go completely and postpone others for the time being.__

What upsets people is not things themselves but their judgments about the things.

Do not seek to have events happen as you want them to, but instead want them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go well.

It is better to die of hunger with distress and fear gone than to live upset in the midst of plenty.

__A little oil is spilled, little wine is stolen: say, “This is the price of tranquillity; this is the price of not being upset.” Nothing comes for free.__

If people think you amount to something, distrust yourself.

You can be invincible if you do not enter any contest in which victory is not up to you.  Enter any contest but the goal must be within your control.

Think about whether you want to exchange these things for tranquillity, freedom, calm.

Be silent for the most part, or say what you have to in a few words. Speak rarely, when the occasion requires speaking, but not about just any topic that comes up,  Avoid banquets given by those outside philosophy. But if the appropriate occasion arises, take great care not to slide into their ways, since certainly if a person's companion is dirty the person who spends time with him, even if he happens to be clean, is bound to become dirty too. _The company you keep gives you permission of how to act.  choose your friends very carefully, you will become them._

__If someone reports back to you that so-and-so is saying bad things about you, do not reply to them but answer, "Obviously he didn't know my other bad characteristics, since otherwise he wouldn't just have mentioned these."__

"What would Socrates or Zeno have done in these circumstances?"

When you go to see someone who is important, put to yourself the thought that you will not find him at home, that you will be shut out, that the door will be slammed, that he will pay no attention to you. If it is appropriate to go even under these conditions, go and put up with what happens, and never say to yourself, "It wasn't worth all that!"" For that is the way of a non-philosopher, someone who is misled by externals.

In your conversations stay away from making frequent and longwinded mention of what you have done and the dangers that you have been in, since it is not as pleasant for others to hear about what has happened to you as it is for you to remember your own dangers. _in the words of vonnegut, "pity the reader"".  speak for them not for you._

Never call yourself a philosopher and do not talk a great deal among non-philosophers about philosophical propositions, but do what follows from them.

If you wish to train yourself to hardship, do it for yourself and not for those outside.

So decide now that you are worthy of living as a full-grown man who is making progress, and make everything that seems best be a law that you cannot go against. And if you meet with any hardship or anything pleasant or reputable or disreputable, then remember that the contest is now and the Olympic games are now and you cannot put things off any more and that your progress is made or destroyed by a single day and a single action.

“Making progress” (prokoptein) is the Stoic expression for movement in the direction of the ideal condition for a human being, embodied by the Stoic “sage”.
