# Book of Five Rings

Musashi it would seem [is] concerned with the elimination of fear, and how to engage in life in a straightforward and unwavering manner.

To Musashi, the martial arts were an approach, or psychology, to the Way.  They were not something to be bought or sold, as so many of the martial arts schools both then and now make them out to be, nor were they something to decorate one's life.  [...] And it is the mind, far more than technique, that will be the enabler.

Musashi insisted on the importance of real experience, and the reader should not miss the fact that the phrase "You should investigate this thoroughly" is repeated more than any other in the book.

## the earth

Musashi's fundamental view of martial arts.

Rules for putting his martial art into practice:

1. Think without dishonesty
2. Forge yourself in the way
3. Touch upon all the arts
4. Know the Ways of all occupations
5. Know the advantages and disadvantages of everything
6. Develop a discerning eye in all matters
7. Understand what cannot be seen by the eye
8. Pay attention to even small things
9. Do not involve yourself in the impractical

## the water

His own style is based on fluidity and purity.

In the Way of the Martial Arts, do not let your frame of mind be anything different than your everyday mind.

Keep the mind straight and in a way that it will allow no personal preference.

Do not let the mind become clouded inside; keep it broad and place your wisdom in that broad place.

Make the everyday body the body for the martial arts, and martial arts body the everyday body.  _NOTE: Your fighting stance is your everyday stance._

There is observation and there is seeing.  The eye of observation is stronger.

In all things, whether it be a the sword or the hand, immobility is undesireable.

This is the principle in which there is, and there is not, a stance.  At its heart, this is first taking up the sword and then cutting down your opponent, no matter what is done or how it happens.  Whether you parry, slap, strike, hold back, or touch your opponent's cutting sword, you much understand that all of these are opportunities to cut him down. [...] All of these are opportunities to win a battle.  It is wrong to be inflexible.

The essence of this is that you take the offensive with both the slap and the strike.

## the fire

Battle and its energy and ability for quick change.

In all things, when your opponent sets up a tactic, respond to it immediately according to its own principles and, stepping on his own actions, defeat him.

Quickly disregard whatever you are thinking and gain the victor by some method unthought of by your opponent.

Time, too, is infectious.

The heart of the Mountains and Seas is that it wrong to use the same tactic repeatedly during a fight between you and your opponent.

No matter how engrossed in the details you are, you should suddenly show great heart and exchange the great and the small.

## the wind

The other style.

The sword handled with a forceful frame of mind is going to be rough, and it is difficult to win with roughness alone.

## emptiness

The place where from which all other activities ultimately come.

__"You should investigate this thoroughly".__
