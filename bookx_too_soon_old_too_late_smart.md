# Too Soon Old Too Late Smart

**If the map doesn't agree with the ground, the map is wrong.**

The qualities we value--kindness, tolerance, capacity for commitment--are not randomly distributed.  They tend to exist as constellations of "traits" that are recognizable and reasonably stable over time.

At the top of the list would be _kindness_, a willingness to give oneself to another.  This most desirable of virtues governs all others.

**We are what we do.**

We are always talking about what we want, what we intend.  These are dreams and wishes and are of little value in changing our mood.  We are not what we think, or what we say, or how we feel.  *We are what we do.*

Many of us are afraid of risk and prefer the bland, the predictable, and the repetitive.

In general we get, not what we deserve, but what we expect.

We love someone when the importance of his or her desires rise to the level of our own.  The point is that love in demonstrated behaviorally.  Once again we define who we are and who and what we care about, not by what we promise, but by what we do.

The worst deceptions, of course, are those we practice on ourselves.

The other thing that true love requires of us is the courage to become totally vulnerable to another.

**It is difficult to remove by logic and idea not place there by logic in the first place.**

The things we do, the prejudices we hold, and the repetetive conflicts that afflict our lives are seldom the products of rational thought.

If most of our behavior is driven by our feelings, however unclear they may be, it follows that to change ourselves we must be able to identify our emotional needs and find ways of satisfying them that do not offend those upon whom our happiness depends. If we wish, as most of us do, to be treated with kindness and forbearance, we deen to cultivate those qualities in ourselves.

People can be so wedded to their particular view of how things should work that they ignore all evidence that suggests that change is necessary.

**We are responsible for most of what happens to us.**

Any relationship is under the control of the person that cares the least.

**Feelings follow behavior.**

[Most people] do not avoid these things because ignorance of their value, but because they are no longer "motivated" to do them.

As much as we try, *we do not control how we feel or what we think.*

It is our determination to overcome fear and discouragement that constitutes the only effective antidote to the sense of powerlessness over unwanted feelings.

Be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid.

**The perfect is the enemy of the good.**

Control is a popular illusion closely related to the pursuit of perfection.

The problem with perfectionists and their preoccupation with control is that the qualities that make them effective in their work can render them insufferable in their personal lives.  *The paradox of perfection:* in some settings, notably our intimate relationships, we gain control only by relinquishing it.

**Life's two most important questions are "Why?" and "Why not?" The trick is knowing which one to ask.**

"The unexamined life is not worth living."

To change such habitual and maladaptive patterns of behavior requires first some recoginition of the pattern.

If people are reluctant to answer "Why?" questions in their lives, they also tend to have trouble with "Why not?" The latter implies risk. Steeped in habit and fearful of change, most of us are to some degree risk-averse. *Particularly in activites that may involve rejection.*

When presented with new things, the operative question may be "Why not?" but people frequently defend themselves from disappointment by asking "Why?"

Something is lost in our obsessive concern with safety and securityâ€”some spirit of adventure.

To take the risks necessary to achiev this goal is an act of courage.  To refuse to take them, to protect our hearts against all loss, is an act of despair.

**Our greatest strengths are our greatest weaknesses.**

A certain amount of compartmentalization is necassary to succeed in the different areas of our lives.

Everything in life is a good news/bad news story.

Only by embracing our mortality can we be happy in the time we have.

**The most secure prisons are the ones we construct for ourselves.**

When we think about loss of freedom, we seldom focus on the ways in which we voluntarily impose constraints on our lives. So much of our lives consist of broken promises to ourselves.

And yet we often do not do what is necessary to become the people we want to be.

*Before we can do anything, we must first be able to imagine it.*

People mistake thoughts, wishes and intentions for actual change.

Focus on the only communication that can be trusted: behavior.

The walls of our self-constructed prisons are made up in equal parts of our fear of risk and our dream that the world and the people in it will conform to our fondest wishes.

**Happiness is the ultimate risk.**

To be happy is to take the risk of losing that happiness.

It is the job of the psychotherapist to re-instill hope.  I frequently ask patients, *"What are you looking forward to?"*

It seems ironic that when people fall in love, no justification for their attachment is necessary.

**Only bad things happen quickly.**

Virtually all the happiness-producing processes in our lives take time, usually a long time.  This is why patience and determination are among life's primary virtues.

Primary among these is the loss of our younger selves.  Our attention spans are notoriously short.

As long as we measures others and ourselves by what we have and how we look, life is inevitably a discouraging experience, characterized by greed, envy, and a desire to be someone else.

**Not all who wander are lost.**

Americans are a linear people.  Among the things frequently neglected in a linear, goal-directed life is sex.  In a culture that is obsessed with it, practically no one feels that they have gotten their share.

Often it is our dalliances and detours that define us.

**There is nothing more pointless, or common, than doing the same thing and expecting different results.**

**It's a poor idea to lie to oneself.**

**Nobody likes to be told what to do.**

**We are afraid of the wrong things.**

**The only real paradises are those we have lost.**

Things were not really better long ago.  What happens as we try to come to terms with our pasts is that we see our lives as a process of continual disenchantment.

The problem with our longing for the paradises of the past is that it distracts us from our efforts to extract pleasure and meaning from the present.

**Of all the forms of courage, the ability to laugh is the most theraputic.**

*It is possible to be happy in the face of our mortality.*

Pessimism like any attitude, contains within it a multitude of self-fulfilling prophecies.

*Things may be grave but they need not be serious.*

**We are never out of choices no matter how desparate the circumstances.  We are not dead yet.**

**Forgiveness is a form of letting go, but they are not the same thing.**

Somewhere between ignoring the past and wallowing in it is a place where we can learn from what has happened to us, including the inevitable mistakes we have made, and integrate this knowledge into our plans for the future.

Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it is a gift for ourselves.
