# John von Neumann

He was puzzled that most other thoughtful people had not noticed that resentment by anybody--from a Nobel Prize-winning colleague, to the president of the United States, or to a waiter--would usually hamper whatever thoughtful people wanted next to or do.

Johnny had put in his mind layers and layers of algebraic verities.  These were the explanation for his extraordinary powers of mental calculation, _like Munger's mental models_.  But he used his accumulation of mathematical constants and equations to become a startling problem-solver and extraordinary concept-expander.  **His ability at concept expanding mattered more.** *Don't have to originate, lots of value in expanding and improving existing ideas.*

He felt the whole concept of numbers had to be reoriented for the computer age, and feared it had not.

He thought the next 3 big break-throughs:

- scientific understanding of the brain
- scientific understanding of the cell/gene
- involvement of computers in conquering the great remaining problems of the physical environment

Johnny suspected that [the lack of progress in economics & sociology] was because we did not yet have enough sorts of mathematics.  He had always recognize that math was too specialized a language.

> "Just as languages like Greek or Sanskrit are historical facts not absolute necessities, it is only reasonable to assume that logics and mathematics are similarly historical, accidental forms of expression."

Economic problems are stated in such vague terms it is quite unclear what the problems really are.

It is therefore expected—or feared—that mathematical discoveries of a stature compared to calculus will be needed in order to produce decisive success in this field [economic or other social science].

He would be worried that computers were being used to back up emotional viewpoints rather than to find out facts. But he would also want computers to help fight pessimism and despair, which he regarded as scientific sins.

The cautious ones generally "committed but few mistakes and were comparatively sterile of truth but no less than of error"; whereas darers, like Archimedes and Johnny, have "discovered much of the highests interests to mathematics and rational thought in general, some of which may be open to destructive criticism, however." His mind was not as original as Leibniz's or Newton's or Einstein's, but he seized other people's original (though fluffy) ideas and quickly changed in expanded detail into a form where they could be useful for scholarship and for mankind. **Johnny's especial skill was to pick out work that surprising and therefore interesting.**

He much preferred to give advice to those who asked for it, not to quarrel with those who did not.

When it shows signs of becoming baroque, then the danger signal is up.  Whenever this stage is reached the only remedy seems to me to be the rejuvenating return to the source: re-injection of more or less directly empirical ideas.

[On sitting with much time to think,] I believe that in a situation like this a kind of guilt or depression worms inside you, and you begin to worry about not getting any ideas. And still nothing happens. Still no ideas come.

He did not believe in a frog-mouse battle about different ways in saying the same thing.

The bomb at Los Alamos required a lot of rough order-of-magnitude estimates.

He saw that the arrival of the computer and other automata would make new methods of numerical analysis important.  I started striving to develop (instead of waiting for) them.

Our present mathematical methods, he said, were developed for slow and purely human procedures of calculation.
