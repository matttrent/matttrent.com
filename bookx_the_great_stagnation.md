# The Great Stagnation

## the low-hanging fruit we ate

America is in disarray because we have consumed all of our low-hanging fruit and haven't adjusted our behavior accordingly.  The 3 main categories of low-hanging fruit are:

1. free land
2. technological breakthroughs
3. smart, uneducated kids

It was easier to produce an important innovation in the 19th centure than in the 20th because innovation was easier back then.

Over the last decade, there are some very wealthy people, but a lot of their incomes are from financial innovations that do not translate to gains for the average american citizen.

Recent and current innovation is more geared to private goods than public goods.

## our new (not so) productive economy

If neither labor nor captila is reaping much gain, can we really trust the productivity numbers?

Government, at the margin, is becoming less productive.  Yet, when measuring GDP, we treat each dollar of government spending as if it is equal in value to the previous dollars that were spent.

Most of the country will feel some amount of deprivation because the fastest-growing sector isn't changing all our lives--now--in the same way that electricity and automobiles did.

Government consumption spending, education spending, and health care spending still exceed 25% of the US GDP.  They are also three of us most rapidly growing sectors.  They are also especially hard to measure value and especialyl hard to bring about accountability and clear results.  They are also 3 sectors where there is massive government distortion of incentives.

People don't want to believe that technology is broken... Pharmaceuticals, robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology--all these areas where the progess has been a lot more limited than people think.  And the question is why.

## does the internet change everything?

The internet is wonderful, but the new low-hanging fruit is in our minds and in our laptops, it is not saving the revenue-generating sector of the economy.

You can be an optimist when it comse to our happiness and personal growth yet still be a pessimist when it comes to generating economic revenue.

The internet is a pubilc good, but you don't benefit from it automatically in the same way you do from a flush toilet or a paved road.

The revenue-intensive sectors of our economy have been slowing down, and the big technological gains are coming in revenue-deficient sectors.

The US labor market is increasingly divided into a group that can keep up with technical work and a group that can't.

## the government of low-hanging fruit

Politics is very difficult in America without much low-hanging fruit.  Nostalgic returns to the past don't work for the same reason.

Instead of admitting its limitations and trying to manage our expectations, government starts lying about what's possible.

The reality is that members of the American left have, whether they like it or not, become the new conservitives.  At least in economic policy, they are usually the defenders of the status quo.

## why did we have such a big financial crisis?

__We thought we were richer than we were.__

The collapse of both markets stemmed from the same underlying forces, namely overconfidence.

When median incomes are stagnant, the main way to consume more is to take out more debt or experience more capital gains.  In the short run, the standard of living went up and people felt richer.

Replacing private debt with public debt won't restore prosperity because it doesn't create anything.  We still haven't fully adjusted to the notion we're poorer than we thought.

Many politicians encourage overborrowing behavior because on the political timeline of 2-6 years, the crash probably won't come before the end of their term.

## can we fix things?

China and India, _in their roles as consumers_, will be encouraging more innovation.

__Raise the social status of scientists.__

If we are going to see further major technological breakthroughs, it is a big help if people love science, care deeply about science, and science attracts a lot of the best American and foreign minds.

__We are living in "the new normal".__

The move from rapid economic growth to very slow growth hasn't ripped apart the government or social fabric of Japan.  Japan is an object lesson of how to live with a slow-growth economy.

## questions

- what would revenue-generating segments of the economy be, if not the technology sector?
