reasons to renegotiate salary

- money
- respect
- validation

why do so few of us actually do it?

## 3 lamest excuses why we don't negotiate, and how to overcome them...

### reason 1. it's too risky

- I don't feel in a position to negotiate
- Not during the recession
- I don't want to rock the boat

If it feels risky... you're doing it wrong

What if instead of just showing up and asking for a raise...
you got your boss to agree for one in advance

Sit down with your boss 3-6 months before you plan to discuss salary

__2 key scripts:__

1. _what would it take for me to be considered a top performer?_

Work quite all the time and not get noticed?
Not about working hard?
Explain and understand from the boss' perspective to be best performer?
Be terrific at what they want

2. _after I do this, I'd like to discuss a potential salary adjustment --
   but let's cross that bridge when we get there._
   
Planting a seed -- not asking -- no commitment / pressure
_adjustment_ - not implying increase and triggering reactance

Stop talking about "I"
Start figuring out what they want

### reason 2. I don't deserve a raise

- I don't feel I have any reason to justify
- I have not been at my job long enough
- I have a very stereotypical entry level job where I could be replaced

__2 answers:__

First, it might be true

1. _We have a tendency to undervalue ourselves (especially young people & women)_

Know you're performing compensation-negating activities, but can't stop them

2. _I'm easily replaceable -- no you're not_

The last thing your boss wants to do is spend time and money replacing you
$6000+, actually

>		What would happen if you went into your boss' office 
>		tomorrow and said "I quit"?

If you're not a top performer, there's only one solutionâ€¦

BECOME ONE!
You can do this in any job, and it doesn't take long (3-6 months)
For the given job you're at

_What have you done in the last 6 months to become a top performer?_

- 	Reading is good
- 	Taking action is much better
- 	Get specific!

3. _Getting a raise just isn't possible in my situation_

- Why?
- We all make up justifications why things don't apply to use
- Self-limiting beliefs
  - For us, the reasons seem so powerful
  - For others, they seem silly and contrived

This may be true -- but check your assumptions
How do you know it's true?
Have you tested it?

"Most of my students didn't think it would work for them until it happened"

Started practicing negotiations against wife and friends
Know the exact phrases and tactics to use
Showed the companies what she could do for them

Negotiating your salary isn't risky or impossible if you do it the right way

You're actually better than you think you are
And then you exceed it

No stress guide to negotiating your salary

Around 27-28, we start to get ok with the idea that the world is not our oyster

Performing is like eating
- we tend to overeat
- we tend to be an average performers

"I don't want to be a nobody"

_Focus on the big wins_
- Not only do it once

## Is this right for me?

It won't work:

- If you work in a union
- If you work in the military
- If you work in the government

## What is holding you back?

- What do you have to lose?
- Failure expectation
- Worst case: you gain experience
