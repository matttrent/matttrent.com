No longer could scientists afford to “concentrate for extended periods of time on one subject” or think deeply “in the silence of the study, confident that rivals would not disrupt their tranquil meditations

Choosing to be prolific, he contended, meant closing off the possibility of doing great work.

Advice for a Young Investigator

Knowledge (and the culture that formed through the accumulation of knowledge) required the marriage of logical and discursive methods (ratio) and contemplative practices and attitudes (intellectus). Intellectus, in turn, was enabled by leisure, which Pieper described as not just a “result of spare time” but “an attitude of non-activity, of inward calm

Knowledge wasn’t just the product of work; how hard you worked to produce it became a measure of how significant and profound the knowledge was

Anything created through contemplation (or religious revelation, or intuition) was, by definition, less impressive and trustworthy.

The whole field of intellectual activity [has been] overwhelmed by the modern ideal of work and is at the mercy of its totalitarian claims,” he wrote, while space for contemplation and leisure had been eliminated in the name of “planned diligence and ‘total labor

Such designs assume that new ideas emerge from a stochastic process of people and ideas bouncing off each other, from brainstorms and chance encounters, rather than from contemplation or deep thinking.

Major discoveries require a “vigorous concentration of mental energy” to “raise to the conscious level” connections between observations made in the laboratory and “ideas slumbering in the unconscious

One must avoid distractions like “malicious gossip” and newspapers, the “intellectual dispersion and waste of time required by social activity

In other words, it is not constant effort that delivers results but a kind of constant, patient, unhurried focus that organizes the investigator’s attention when at work and is present but watchful during periods of ease

the better-developed your DMN, other scientists have found, the better able you are to construct models of other people’s minds.

slightly, while the resting group actually dropped a bit. The jokers in the pack were the undemanding task group: they were 40 percent more creative the second time and outperformed everybody else by a wide margin. Having to do the simple task didn’t wreck their creativity; on the contrary, because it gave them the chance to do a little mind-wandering, members of the fourth group had time to subconsciously work on the AUT.

The generative and evaluative functions are thought to take place in different parts of the brain, both of which are part of the DMN. In this theory one would expect that in creative people, the generative function would have more freedom to produce ideas, and the evaluative function would be less tightly integrated into the DMN.

The first stage, preparation, consists of all the visible, conscious activity necessary in modern creative and productive work

most creative breakthroughs happen when you’re immersed in a problem, familiar with all its parts, and examining it from every angle

So the preparation phase is absolutely necessary in creative thinking. Sometimes that works, but with big problems, often you hit a wall

To get past a mental block, whether you’re working with brainteasers or brain science, you have to move on to the next stage in Wallas’s model: incubation

At some point, though, the answer will feel within reach. At this point, Wallas warns, it is important not to force it, as returning your attention to the problem “may have the effect of interrupting or hindering it.” Instead, you have to trust that your unconscious will drive to the third phase, illumination, the moment when the answer bursts into your consciousness

exertion, like an inspiration,” as German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz said. From there, it is on to the verification phase: you set the solution on a logical foundation, fill in the details, or fit it into a bigger project

Despite their elusive and evasive properties, might it be possible that we can treat incubation and illumination as skills and discover ways to make them more dependable

skills every day. That’s why they develop and refine daily routines and practices that preserve time for mind-wandering, sharpen their sensitivity to insights, and allow them to capture moments of illumination

We must take advantage of all lucid moments, whether they occur during the meditation following prolonged rest; during the super-intense mental work nerve cells achieve when fired by concentration; or during scientific discussion, whose impact often generates unanticipated intuition like sparks from steel

WHEN YOU EXAMINE the lives of history’s most creative figures, you are immediately confronted with a paradox: they organize their lives around their work, but not their days

Their creativity and productivity, in other words, were not the result of endless hours of toil. Their towering creative achievements result from modest “working” hours.

So despite their differences in personality and the different quality of their achievements, both Darwin and Lubbock managed something that seems increasingly alien today. Their lives were full and memorable, their work was prodigious, and yet their days are also filled with downtime.

If you assume that the most productive office and home workers in this study are the same, this cohort is working between twenty-five and thirty-eight hours a week. In a six-day week, that works out to an average of four to six hours a day.

Deliberate practice,” they observed, “is an effortful activity that can be sustained only for a limited time each day.” Practice too little and you never become world-class. Practice too much, though, and you increase the odds of being struck down by injury, draining yourself mentally, or burning out

This upper limit, Ericsson concluded, is defined “not by available time, but by available [mental and physical] resources for effortful practice

The top performers actually slept about an hour a day more than the average performers. They didn’t sleep late. They got more sleep because they napped during the day. Of course there was lots of variability, but the best students generally followed a pattern of practicing hardest and longest in the morning, taking a nap in the afternoon, and then having a second practice in the late afternoon or evening

The best performers devoted more energy to organizing their time, thinking about how they would spend their time, and assessing what they did

In other words, the top students were applying some of the habits of deliberate practice—mindfulness, an ability to observe their own performance, a sense that their time was valuable and needed to be spent wisely—to their downtime

My morning is all about stilling the outside world so my mind can soar

They start work earlier, sometimes before dawn, even if they’re night owls rather than early risers. They concentrate on their most challenging work first, when their creative energy is likely to be at its peak. They believe in inspiration but don’t wait for it; instead, they find that work creates the conditions for inspiration. And they discover that rest improves rather than inhibits their creativity and can make them more productive, not less

Arnold Sommerfeld, a mathematician and theoretical physicist who trained some of the twentieth century’s greatest physicists, insisted that serious science required an early morning start

ago. As a student I burned lots of midnight oil, but once I had a job and children, I struggled to muster the energy to write at night. So I tried getting up before dawn and writing before anyone else in the house was up. To my surprise, not only did I have more time to write, the words came more easily: I was less prone to self-distraction and had just enough energy and awareness to write

Hans Selye’s early morning office, for example, was a space that surrounded him with “helpful” distractions like journal articles, books, and notes and insulated him from the “misleading” distractors of students and administrative duties

It is too easy, when rather tired, to fritter a whole day away with the intention of working but never getting properly down to it,” Littlewood said. “This is pure waste, nothing is done, and you have had no rest or relaxation.” Virtually every prolific author and scientist would agree. A day that starts with work creates rest that can be enjoyed without guilt. When you start early, the rest you take is the rest you’ve earned.

CREATIVE PEOPLE WHO discover deliberate rest don’t just spend a few focused hours each day working or prefer to concentrate their effort in the morning. They work the same hours of the day, every day, often seven days a week. Stephen King exemplifies the attitude that routine is critical to creative production

The reason it’s necessary to start writing, and to keep writing, is that creativity doesn’t drive the work; the work drives creativity. A routine creates a landing place for the muse

Professional chefs and line cooks, for example, put lots of energy into assembling their mise-en-place, the implements, ingredients, spices and sauces they’ll need during their shift. Like a hiker’s pack or a doctor’s surgical tray, the mise-en-place should have everything a cook needs to deal with any situation, organized for effortless retrieval. Indeed, chefs describe the mise-en-place as both a physical organization and a state of mind, and teach that the one supports the other: having all tools and ingredients in exactly the right place lets chefs get into that state of flow that permits them to work quickly and at a high level

It’s expressed in the phrase solvitur ambulando (“it is solved by walking”), variously attributed to the Greek philosopher Diogenes

My mind often comes to a standstill after some hours indoors,” he said, but on a walk “my mind immediately begins to move freely and instinctively over my subject. Ideas come rushing to my mind, without being called

The sudden and unexpected nature of the insights make for dramatic stories, but a closer look reveals that all of these examples follow Wallas’s model of preparation, incubation, and illumination

Indeed, many studies show that walking has a detrimental effect on tasks that require focused thinking and attention to detail. “It’s not that we should all get treadmill desks and get on them all the time,” Oppezzo says, “because it turns out it’s probably only good for a couple types of thinking.”
