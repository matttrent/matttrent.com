__Deep Work:__ Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.  These efforts create new value, improve your skill and are hard to replicate.

## Deep work is valuable

Deep work is valuable because it gives you the ability to quickly master hard things and to produce at an elite level.

Rise of technology is transforming labor markets.  3 specific groups that will fall on the lucrative side of this transformation:

- _high-skilled workers_, such as Nate Silver, those with oracular abilities to work with and tease valuable results of out increasingly complex machines
- _superstars_, such as elite software engineers, those at the absolute top of their field will capture a disproportionately large share of any winner-take-all market
- _the owners_, such as venture capitalists, because technology reduces the amount of labor, skewing the returns to those with capital

Membership of the first 2 groups, and success in the new economy, can be accessed by 2 abilities:

1. The ability to quickly master hard things
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.

These 2 abilities depend on your ability to perform deep work.  Deep work helps you learn hard things quickly.  Deep work helps you produce at an elite level.

$$ high\_quality\_work\_produced = time\_spend \times intensity\_of\_focus$$

## Deep work is rare

A confluence of different trends is making deep work progressively rare.  The value of knowledge work is difficult to quantify causing people to take the path of least resistance and end up using busyness as proxy for productivity.  Combined with distracting Internet technologies that can easily be low-value, deep work is at an all-time low.  This can be an advantage if you choose to cultivate it.

Feynmann had some thoughts on avoiding busy work:

>   To do real good physics work, you need absolute solid lengths of time... it needs a lot of concentration... if you have a job administering anything, you don't have the time.  So I have invented another myth for myself: I'm irresponsible.  I'm actively irresponsible.  I tell everyone I don't do anything.  If anyone asks me to be on a committee for admissions, "no," I tell them: I'm irresponsible.

Feynmann, we can assume, was probably bad at responding to emails and would likely switch universities if you had tried to move him into an open office or demand he tweet.

Knowledge work is not an assembly line, and extracting value from information is an activity that's often at odds with busyness, not supported by it.

We were, he noted, no longer discussing the trade-offs surrounding new technologies.

## Deep work is meaningful

>   The skillful management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving virtual every aspect of your experience.

Our brains [...] construct our worldview base on _what we pay attention to_.  If you focus on a cancer diagnosis, you and your life become unhappy and dark, but if you focus instead on an evening martini, you and your life become more pleasant -- even though the circumstances in both scenarios are the same.

They were instead happier because they rewired their brains to ignore the negative and savor the positive.  They improved their world without improving anything concrete about it.

The idle mind is the devil's workshop... when you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong in your life instead of what's right.

The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.

In our current culture we place a lot of emphasis on job description [...] motivated by the flawed idea that what matters most for your career satisfaction is the specifics of the job you choose.  You don't need a rarified job; you need instead a rarified approach to your work.

## Rule 1: work deeply

You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it.

Add _routines_ and _rituals_ to your working life to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary.

Deep work can produce extreme productivity, but only if the subject dedicates enough time to such endeavours to reach maximum cognitive intensity.

The aspects to consider when developing a deep work plan are:

- decide on your deep work philosophy
- ritualize your behavior
- make grand gestures to push your boundarize
- don't work alone, when it's productive
- execute like a business
- be lazy to recharge your batteries

There are 4 philosophies to consider:

1.  __monastic philosophy:__ maximizing deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations.  This approach works best when the bulk of professional success comes from doing one thing exceptionally well.  Donald Knuth and Neal Stephenson are example hermits.
2.  __bimodal philosophy:__ divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches and leaving the rest open to everything else.  The minimum unit of time for deep work tends to be at least one full day.  Taking long weekend or longer retreats are an example.
3.  __rhythmic philosophy:__ the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a habit.  Use the chain method or a scheduled time to make daily progress.  By supporting deep work with rock-solid routines that make sure a little bit gets done on a regular basis, the rhythmic scheduler will often log a larger total number of deep hours per year. 
4.  __journalist philosophy:__ where you fit deep work whereever you can into your schedule.  This approach is not for the deep work novice.

The decision between rhythmic and bimodal can come down to your self-control in such scheduling matters.

>   The best advice I can offer to anyone trying to do creative work is to ignore inspiration.

You need to build rituals for your deep work habit.  The exact specifics are up to you, but when building your ritual, you need to explicity address each of the following issues:

1. __where you'll work and for how long.__  If it's possible to identify a location only for deep work, do so.
2. __how you'll work once you start work.__  Without this structure you'll have to mentally litigate again and again what you should and hsould not be doing during these sessions.
3. __how you'll support your work__, including anything from a coffee to signal the beginning to having organized the necessary materials beforehand.

Consider grand gestures, leveraging a radical change to your normal environment to increase the perceived importance of the task.  Additionally, working with someone else at the proverbial shared whiteboard can push you deeper than if you were working alone.

It often turns out that execution is more difficult than strategizing and you need to support the actually getting-work-done part.  When implementing your deep work plan, consider the following framework of 4 disciplines:

1. __focus on the wildly important,__ where execution should be aimed at a small number of "wildly important goals"
2. __act on lead measures,__ which model the behavior that will drive success. In the case of deep work the lead measure is time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal.
3. __keep a compelling scoreboard,__ which should be a physical artifact in the workspace that displays the current deep work hour count.
4. __create a cadence of accountability,__ where you schedule a weekly time to review your project.

>   Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensible to the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer from a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets...it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done.

Inject regular and substantial freedom from professional concerns into your day, providing you with the idleness paradoxically required to get (deep) work down.  You could hide out in an "undisclosed location".  At the very least show down your consideration of work issues until the next morning -- no after-dinner email check.

__Downtime aids insights.__  Some decisions are better left to your unconscious mind to untangle.  For decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple, vague and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue.  A shutdown habit is not necessarily reducing the amount of time you're engaged in productive work, but instead diversifying the type of work you deploy.

__Downtime helps recharge the energy needed to work deeply.__

__The work that evening downtime replaces is usually not that important.__ There is a limit on the amount of cognitively demanding work that can be done in a day.  For experts that number can be as high as 4 hours -- but rarely more.  By evening, you're beyond the point where you can continue to efficiently work deeply.  The work you will do is almost certainly lower value.

To ensure you stop working at the end of the day, you need a _shutdown ritual_. Incomplete tasks can dominate your attention, so make a plan for how you will _later_ complete incomplete tasks. This ritual should ensure every incomplete task, goal or project has been reviewed and that for each you have confirmed that either (1) you have a plan that your trust for its completion or (2) it's captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right:

1. Take a final look at your email inbox.  
2. Transfer any new tasks that are on your mind to your official task lists.  
3. Quickly review every task in every list, and then look at the next few days on your calendar.

## Rule 2: embrace boredom

Your ability to concentrate is only as strong as your commitment to train it.  As such your two goals should be: improving your ability to concentrate intensely and overcoming your desire for distraction.

The creative insights that [...] now experiences in his professional life, in other words, have little to do with a onetime decision to think deeper, and much to do with a commitment to training this ability early every morning.

>   People who multitask all the time can't filter out irrelevancy.  They can't manage a working memory.

__Don't take breaks from distraction.  Instead take breaks from focus.__ Once you're wired for distraction, you crave it.  Schedule in advance when you'll use the internet, and then avoid it altogether outside those times.  The exact schedule is unimportant _as long as your hold yourself to it and avoid the urge to distract yourself_.  You can get even more benefits from maintaining this strategy after the workday is over, providing plenty of opportunities to resist switching to distractions at the slightest sign of boredom.

__Use panic as productivity system.__  With sufficiently tight deadlines, the stress of completing the task at hand can push all distracting thoughts out of your head.  At that point, there should be only one possible way to get the deep work done in time: _working with great intensity._ Committing to things that require superhuman effort can push you to new depths.

__Meditate productively on deep work problems,__ as a means to strengthen your distraction-resisting muscles and sharpen your concentration. As in mindfulness meditation, you much bring your concentration back to the problem at hand when it wanders.  When doing so, be alert for looping, where you replace portions you already know rather than digging deeper.

To more productively solve mental problems you need to structure things:  

1. review the _relevant variables_ for solving the problem
2. define the _next-step question_ you need to answer using these variables
3. _consolidate_ your gains by reviewing clearly the answer you identified

A side effect of memory training is an improvement in your general ability to concentrate.

## Rule 3: quit social media

Quit social media.  A careful review of the most important goals in your life will likely reveal social media isn't helping achieve any of them.

We generally adopt an "any-benefit" approach to network tools where we accept them if there is any gain at all, ignoring opportunity cost of time and attention favoring that tool over something else.  Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on the factors you value outweight its negative impacts.

>   It's amazing how overly accessible people are.  There's a lot of communication in my life that's not enriching, it's impoverishing.

Triage your digital tools by:

1. identify the main high-level goals in both your professional and personal lives 
2. for each of these goals, list the 2 or 3 most important activities that help you satisfy that goal
3. for each tool, go through the key activities you identified and ask whether the use of the tool has a substantially positive impact, a substantially negative impact or little impact

By taking the time consumed by low-impact activities---like finding old friends on Facebook---and reinvesting in high-impact activities---like taking a good friend out to lunch---you end up more successful in your goal.

__TODO:__ make the preparations to quit facebook and twitter for a month.  Even if I don't do it, it's valuable to have everyone's phone number and email as well as any other relevant information I feel I need. 

>   The great and profound mistake which my typical man makes in regards to his day [is] he persists in looking upon those hours from ten to six as 'the day', to which the ten hours preceeding them and the six hours following them are nothing but a prologue and an epilogue.  Utterly illogical and unhealthy.

## Rule 4: drain the shallows

>   When you have fewer hours in you usually spend the more wisely.

Treat shallow work with suspicion because its damage is often vastly underestimate and its importance vastly overestimated.

__Schedule every minute of your day.__  Decide in advance what you're going to do with every minute of your workday.  Your goal is not to stick to a given schedule at all costs; it's instead to maintain, at all times, a thoughtful say in what you're doing with your time going forward---even if those decisions are reworked again and again as the day unfolds.

When doing so, recognize that _almost definitely_ you're going to underestimate.  Use overflow conditional blocks in your schedule, blocking off the expected time, then follow this with an additional block that has a split purpose.  Liberally schedule task blocks throughout the day to budget time for things that come up in the course of a normal day.  __Don't only allow for spontaneity in your schedule; ecourage it.__  Continually ask "what makes sens for me to do with the time that remains?"

__Quantify the depth of every activity__ in terms of how long in months it would take train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in your field to the complete the task.

__Set a shallow work budget__ and discuss it with your boss.  By picking and sticking to a shallow-to-deep ratio, you can relpace a guilt-driven unconditional acceptance of new work with a more health habit of trying to get the most out of the time you have put aside for shallow work, but keeping these efforts contstrained to small enough fraction of your time to enable the deep work that ultimately drives your business forward.

__Commit to fixed-schedule productivity,__ enforcing a firm goal of not working past a certain time (perhaps 7pm for me), then working backwards to find productivity strategies that allow you to satisfy this declaration.  By refusing the shallow while preserving the deep, you free up your time without diminishing the amount of new value we generate.

Limits to our time necessitate more careful thinking about our organizational habits.  __If you have to choose just one behavior that reorients your focus towards the dee, this should be high on your list.__

The most dangerous work in one's productivity vocabulary is "yes".  Any obligation beyond your deepest efforts is suspect and seen as potentially disruptive.  Your default answer becomes no.  When refusing be clear in your refusal but ambiguous in your explanation to avoid the requesting party suggesting a way to work things.

__Become hard to reach.__  Make the people who send you email do mork work.  Do more work when you send or reply to email to avoid many subsequent disruptive back-and-forth emails.  Ask "what project is represented by this message, and what is the most efficient (in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this project to a successful conclusion?"  

__Don't respond,__ unless the sender has demonstrated a reply is worthwhile.  Don't reply to an email if any of the following applies:

- It's ambiguous or otherwise makes it hard to generate a reasonable response
- It's not a question or proposal that interests you
- Nothing really good would happen if you did respond and nothing really bad would happen if you didn't
