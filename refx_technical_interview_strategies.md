# refx technical interview strategies

## 5 steps to answer a question

1. ask to resolve ambiguity
    - in the range of 3-5 questions
    - make sure to make all your assumptions explicit
2. design algorithm
    - state algorithmic complexity, ask if what they expect
    - are you making the right tradeoffs?
    - are you using all the info?
3. write pseudo code
    - assume valid input / error checking?
    - ask if they would like you to go to the whiteboard
    - spend 5-7 minutes on pseudocode
4. write actual code
    - use as many data structures as you can
5. test
    - general cases
    - extreme cases
    - user error

## 5 algorithmic approaches

### 1. examplify

- write out specific examples
- derive a rule

### 2. pattern matching

- consider related problems and their algorithms
- modify that solution to match this problem

### 3. simplify and generalize

- change a constraint (size, datatype) to simplify
- choose a solution to the simpler problem
- generalize the solution to the original problem

### 4. base case and build

- solve n=1
- solve n=2,3 given n=1
- work up to general rules
- often yields recursive solution

### 5. data structure brainstorm

- run through all the data structures you can
- do a thought experiment on how you would proceed with that

## properties of good code

- correct
- efficient
- simple
- readable
- maintainable

### other rules

- use data structures generously
- appropriate code reuse
- modular
- flexible and robust
- error checking
