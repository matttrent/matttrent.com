he was a youth blessed with the sublime lightheartedness that flourishes only in an age of strife.

He wondered if his chaste devotion to the Way of the Sword would crumble, like a landslide, under the weight of her tears.

It is easy to crush an enemy outside oneself but impossible to defeat an enemy within.

The sight of blood, which makes a brave man cooler, has the opposite effect on cowards.

He wasn't putting theory into practice; he fought first and theorized later.

"Should I throw away my sword and live like an ordinary man?" he asked himself, not for the first time. In the clear, early evening sky, the white petals of the cherry blossoms fell randomly, like flakes of snow, leaving the trees looking as vulnerable as he now felt, vulnerable to doubts about whether he should not change his way of life. "If I give up the sword, I could live with Otsū," he thought. But then he remembered the easygoing lives of the Kyoto townspeople and the world inhabited by Kōetsu and Shōyū.
"That's not for me," he said decisively.

Still, Musashi thought, if a man dwells only on the dangers ahead, he cannot advance a single step, let alone make his way through life successfully.

He wanted to make a change, a radical one, since he'd long suspected that only those who had actually grown their own grain and vegetables really understood how sacred and valuable they were.

He wanted to conquer himself, to make life itself submit to him, to cause people to live rather than die.

Do not attempt to oppose the way of the universe. But first make sure you know the way of the universe.

Instead of wanting to be like this or that, make yourself into a silent, immovable giant. That's what the mountain is. Don't waste your time trying to impress people. If you become the sort of man people can respect, they'll respect you, without your doing anything.

Alas, though sufficiently grown up to worry about the future, he was still young enough to be easily distracted by the sight of a buzzing cicada.

If you master the inner meaning of the Way of the Samurai, the discipline can be applied to the use of the lance, or even guns. If you know the sword, you don't make silly mistakes or get taken unawares. Swordsmanship is an art with universal applications.

The moonlight fell softly on the tatami.

It pleased him that today, as on other days, he had on spotless underwear, in the tradition of the good samurai, who started each day with a smile and an uncertainty: by evening he might be a corpse.

To him, any place could serve as home—more than that: wherever he happened to be was the universe.

At times, he'd had the feeling he had been born too late.

Why worry about that? It'd be strange if a man your age had too good a reputation. So long as you haven't done anything disloyal or ignoble or rebellious, what does it matter? I'm more interested in hearing about your training.

If a man not yet thirty claims to know the least bit about the Way, it's an unmistakable sign his growth has stopped.

Be thankful that others don't overestimate you, that you don't have to pay attention to appearances.

Musashi knew he was being accepted in this select circle not because of who he was. He was seeking the Way, just as they were. It was the Way that permitted such free camaraderie.

An old saying came back to his mind: it is easy to surpass a predecessor, but difficult to avoid being surpassed by a successor. 

Wars, like the typhoon we had, pass. The land as a whole is unchanged, but we must never forget the debt we owe to the white bones under the ground.

While custom was bred by daily experience, being on the boundary between life and death was something that occurred only a few times during a lifetime. Yet the ultimate aim of the Way of the Sword was to be able to stand on the brink of death at any time: facing death squarely, unflinchingly, should be as familiar as all other daily experiences. And the process had to be a conscious one, though movement should be as free as if it were purely reflexive.

To Takuan, both he and the other man were basically a bundle of illusions wrapped in human skin.

It occurred to Musashi what an odd fact it was that most children could draw—and sing, for that matter—but that they forgot how to as they grew older. Perhaps the little bit of wisdom they acquired inhibited them.

As in the case of other adults who have forgotten how to draw, his mind would work, but not his spirit. Intent upon drawing skillfully, he was unable to express himself naturally.

Hyōgo tried to rein in his emotions. Warriors had weak moments, foolish moments, like everybody else. Still, his duty, that of every samurai, was clear: to persevere until he reached a state of stoic balance.

The conclusion I've come to is that life is enjoyment. Without enjoyment, what use is there in living?

Then they turned into fawning sycophants. And from morning to night, they talked of money, money. If it was not that, it was work, work.

I'm still a child at heart. I'm practicing along with the children.

"If you can bear up under hardship, you can experience a pleasure greater than the pain," Musashi said solemnly. "Day and night, hour by hour, people are buffeted by waves of pain and pleasure, one after the other. If they try to experience only pleasure, they cease to be truly alive. Then the pleasure evaporates."

Almost any fief would be willing to pay him enough to live on, perhaps five hundred to a thousand bushels. But when he put it to himself in the form of a question, the answer was always no. An easy existence imposed restrictions; he could not submit to them.

There are times when I wonder if I have any future. I feel completely empty. It's like being confined in a shell. I hate myself. I tell myself I'm no good. But by chastising myself and forcing myself to go on, I manage to kick through the shell. Then a new path opens up before me.

trying, like a baby being born, to find in the twofold mysterious pain of sadness and ecstasy a life worth living.


It was not a matter merely of being idle, which is often a pleasant state, but of wanting desperately to do something and not being able to.

But his intention to kick through the shell before it was well formed had failed.

Danger was the grindstone on which the swordsman whetted his spirit. Enemies were teachers in disguise.

His plan came to him like a flash of light. It was not reasoned out by the theories of the Art of War, which constituted the fiber of the trained warrior's intuition. To reason out a mode of attack was a dilatory process, often resulting in defeat in situations where speed was of the essence. The warrior's instinct was not to be confused with animal instinct. Like a visceral reaction, it came from a combination of wisdom and discipline. It was an ultimate reasoning that went beyond reason, the ability to make the right move in a split second without going through the actual process of thinking.

Speculation wouldn't get him very far. The Art of War demanded that he find out where he stood and act accordingly.

If I desert the Way, I fall into the depths. Yet when I try to pursue it to the peak, I find I'm not up to the task. I'm twisting in the wind halfway up, neither the swordsman nor the human being I want to be.

Matahachi's problems did not seem to disable him. Musashi always seemed to be searching out new problems with which to torture himself.

I laugh at my ten-year pilgrimage—
Wilted robe, tattered hat, knocking at Zen gates.
In reality, the Buddha's Law is simple:
Eat your rice, drink your tea, wear your clothes.


His reaction was almost one of fear, that the adulation might go to his head. He was, after all, only an ordinary man.

He needed to develop harmony, to make sure his ideas did not outpace his ability to act. 

That's what's extraordinary about him. He's not content with relying on whatever natural gifts he may have. Knowing he's ordinary, he's always trying to improve himself. No one appreciates the agonizing effort he's had to make. Now that his years of training have yielded such spectacular results, everybody's talking about his 'god-given talent.' That's how men who don't try very hard comfort themselves.

At last, at an age when simply being alive was something to be thankful for, she was learning for the first time what it was like to be loved and respected by others.

The whole point of the Art of War is to be quick to seize an opening. Even when a man takes precautions, it often happens that his opponent will have anticipated them and devised means of offsetting them. It's much better to approach the situation with an open mind and move with perfect freedom.

Musashi was watching a small cloud in the sky. As he did, his soul returned to his body, and it became possible for him to distinguish between the cloud and himself, between his body and the universe.

Kojirō had put his confidence in the sword of strength and skill. Musashi trusted in the sword of the spirit. That was the only difference between them.
