title: STOLEN Cunningham Drago

Monday, 21 March 2016, my road bike was stolen from the supply area in the basement of my office building at the intersection of Van Ness and Golden Gate in San Francisco.

The frame is custom hand-built under the builder name Cunningham. The model name is Drago. The frame color is dark purple/midnight blue with bright orange tires and handlebar tape. 

The current photo is slightly out of date.  The wheels have been replaced with a set of Durace hubs with white spokes.  All the other components are late-80s Shimano Tri-color 600, with previous owner's name is etched into many of them.

I'm offering a $400 reward for the return of the bike.  Please get in contact with me at 415.326.3226 or <mailto:contact@matttrent.com>.
