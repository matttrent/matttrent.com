# Get Lucky

## skill 1: motion

Before serendipity can occur, you have to get outside the confines of your normal routine, most likely getting up and physically moving somewhere neew to be exposed to novelty.

## skill 2: preparation

>   "Chance favors only prepared minds."
>   -- Louis Pasteur

- what exactly is a prepared mind?
- driven by pure curiousity
- "arrest an exception" -- never letting exceptions pass unnoticed
- forget what you know to be true, start from first principles

- cannot create new opportunities in the world if we do not first create room in our minds
- what does this mean in practice?
- logical leaps of the mind
- __abductive reasoning:__ the purpose is not observation but wondering
- be able to observe in an entirely new way

>   "Logic will get you from A to B, but imagination will take you everywhere."
>       -- Albert Einstein

- construal level theory
- our minds represent things differently depending on psychological distance
- perceive distance forces us to be more abstract in our thinking
- everyday experiences are transformed into something less routine or familiar

- adopt experimental attitude
- everything is speculative, tinkering, exploration or playful
- embracing the likelihood of it being incomplete or unsuccessful

>   "I haven't failed.  I've just found 10,000 ways that don't work."
>   -- Thomas Edison

- find a small project in an area where there's potential for more interest
- in depth research, understand it from first principles
- write a series of blog posts to explore the topic further
- set aside time and space to do the work and indulge the obsession 
- __NOTE__: these are the deep work projects cal newport extols 

## skill 3: divergence

- our insecurity can make it harder to abandon the comfortable, the routine, the well-defined
- uncertainty downgrades our opinions of new ideas
- thinking there's only one answer downgrade our opinions of new ideas
- the uncertainty associated with new directions makes them psychologically less attractive to us

Continually branch of your core area and rigorously explore the continually expanding adjacent possible.  Understand you must actively manage this process because as your progress you will be come more loss-averse, and more willing to stay with in the confines you know and understand.

## skill 4: commitment

- Being rooted in purpose is often the only meaningful way to decide which of our many paths to take.
- The discovery was only reached after saying "no" to the expedient but ill-fitted choices

- Don't focus on the means (in the case of Borders physical bookstores)
- Rather the underlying need (in the case of Borders, enjoying books and media)
- In the case of Sprig, it might not be: "deliverying healthy pre-made meals in 15 minutes"
- But rather, making eating well easier than not eating well

__The structure of our business life and creeping demands and expectations it insists upon systematically alienate us from things that truly matter to us.__

## skill 5: activation

## skill 6: connection

## skill 7: permeability

## skill 8: attraction

- attraction is what happens when we take our commitment to our project
- when we find our purpose and stick to it
- and then turn towards the eyes and ears of the public
- project our purpose to broadcasting our intent
- build our reputation to how we develop a positive public identity
- transforming our environment to change what people believe is possible by placing ourselves as role models in pursuit of a new and audacious goal
- amplify our message to create a feedback loop to perpetuate it

- __what is my purpose?  what is the meaning for me?__

- people with a strong sense of meaning attract other people
- subjects with more meaning in life were viewed as more likeable, better potentian friends and more desireable conversation partners
- to win friends and influence people there is no substitute for living a meaningful life.

Have a purpose and be willing to put yourself out there on the line.  You will attract what you need.
