### 2. Chemistry: 1813–1820

They reason theoretically, without demonstrating experimentally, and errors are the result

### 4. A Circular Force: 1820–1831

We shall never know what Faraday would have achieved had he mastered mathematics, but, paradoxically, his ignorance may have been an advantage. It led him to derive his theories entirely from experimental observation rather than to deduce them from mathematical models

The nature of Faraday's genius is hard to pin down, but his mastery of the lecture offers some clues: his knowledge of the subject came not from what he had read or been told but from personal observation; he looked and listened with rare intensity and was able to capture subtle effects and nuances that passed other people by. By the same token, he took pains to identify all the factors that contributed to an audience's enjoyment and evaluated their effects, both singly and in combination. Perhaps the most revealing aspect is that he never demonstrated an experiment on stage, no matter how spectacular, unless he could also present the audience with the theory behind it. His scientific genius lay not simply in producing experimental results that had eluded everyone else but in explaining them, too.

The idea of a circular force was quite beyond the generally accepted doctrine of Newtonian forces, and Faraday's lack of a traditional scientific education probably made it easier for him to accept it

### 5. Induction: 1831–1840

The most startling result of Faraday's law is perhaps this. If we accept the hypothesis that the elementary substances are composed of atoms, we cannot avoid concluding that electricity also, positive as well as negative, is divided into elementary portions, which behave like atoms of electricity

findings in accurate language, and to his skill in communication. New words were needed not for their own sake but because existing ones carried theoretical baggage that could constrain one's thinking

These were remarkable results, but mathematical physicists, whether in Britain, in France, or elsewhere paid them little attention. Messy, smelly chemistry was outside their province, and they cared little for it

Living, working and daily investigating in his laboratory, in the presence of all his apparatus, he gave his thoughts free play around the phenomena, incessantly framing theories to account for the observed facts and then testing his ideas by experiment, never hesitating to push these ideas suggested by his experiments to their logical conclusion, no matter how much they may have diverged from the accepted scientific theories of the day

### 6. A Shadow of a Speculation: 1840–1857

If it conducted lines of force better than the surrounding medium, it would act like a paramagnet; and if it conducted lines of force less well than the surrounding medium, it would act like a diamagnet. So simple. There was no poles at all, in the sense of centers of force. There was no attraction or repulsion, and certainly no action at a distance; all that happened was that bodies reacted to the patterns of lines of force in their own localities—in other words, to the field

But to Faraday, experimental results were the only truth. He had always been prepared to abandon any line of inquiry the moment his results showed it to be false

### 12. The Speed of Light: 1860–1863

In this class, I hope you will learn not merely results, or formulae applicable to cases that may possibly occur in our practice afterwards, but the principles on which those formulae depend, and without which the formulae are mere mental rubbish.
I know the tendency of the human mind is to do anything rather than think. But mental labor is not thought, and those who have with labor acquired the habit of application often find it much easier to get up a formula than to master a principle.1

Any medium that possessed both elasticity and inertia should be able to transmit waves, and his had both

An obstacle was embedded deep in the scientific thinking of the time. Immersed in Newton's clockwork universe, people had thought that all physical phenomena resulted from some kind of mechanical action (combined, where appropriate, with forces such as gravity, which acted instantaneously at a distance) and that all would be clear to us if, and only if, we discovered the true mechanisms.

A characteristic of Maxwell's work, indeed his life, was that he seemed to take everything in his stride—he was never hurried
