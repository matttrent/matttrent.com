## ten commandments for aspiring superforecasters

### 1. triage

Concentrate on questionts in the Goldilocks zone of difficulty, where effort pays off the most.  Don't wast time on either on easy "clocklike" questions or on impenetrable "cloud-like" questions.  Bear in mind the two basic errors it is possible to make here.  We could fail to predice the potentially predictable or we could waste our time trying to predict the unpredictable.

### 2. Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable subproblems

Fermi-ize problems.  Decompose the problem into its knowable and unknowable parts.  Dare to be wrong by making your best guesses.  Better to discover errors quickly than to hid them behind vague verbiage.  The surprise is how often remarkably good probability estimates arise rfom a remarkable crude series of assumptions and guestimates.

### 3. Strike the right balance between inside and outside views

Don't get caught up on the specifics of the individual problem.  Conduct creative searches for camparison classes even for seemingly unique events.  How often do things of this sort happen in situations of this sort?  Balance the outside's generalizations with the insides specifics.

### 4. Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence.

Belief updating is to good forecasting as brushing and flossing are to good dental hygiene.  It's boring and uncomfortable but pays off in the long.  Strive to incrementally update, moving from probabilities of, say, 0.4 to 0.35 or from 0.6 to 0.65 (or smaller), distinctions too subtle to capture with vague verbiage.  Also know how to jump, to move the probability estimate fast in response to diagnostic signals.

### 5. Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem.

For every good policy argument htere is typically a counterargument that is at least worth acknowledging.  Synthesis is an art that requires reconciling irreducibly subjective decisions.

### 6. Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more.

The more degrees of uncertainty you can distinguish, the better a forecaster you are likely to be.  Use fine granualarity than is accomodated by language.  Rely on numbers for probabilities.  Force yourself to discern and be analytical.

### 7. Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness.

Superforecasters understand the riskes both of rushing to judgement and dawdling too longe near "maybe".  It is not enough to avoid the most recent mistake.  Find creative ways to tamp down both types of forecasting errors--misses and false alarms--to a degree a fickle world permits such uncontroversial improvements in accuracy.

### 8. Look for the errosr behind your mistakes but beward of rearview-mirror hindsight issues.

Don't try to justify or excuse your failures.  Own them!  Conduct unflinching postmortems: Where exactly did I go wrong?  Don't forget to do postmortems on your successes too.  Not all successes imply that your reasoning was right.

### 9. Bring out the best in others and let others bring out the best in you

Master the fine arts of team managment, especially perspective taking, precision questioning and constructive confrontation.

### 10. Master the error-balancing bicycle

Just as your can't learn to ride a bicycle by reading a physics textbook, you can't become a superforecaster by reading training manuals.  Like all forms of expertise, superforecasting is the production of deep, deliberate practice.

### 11. Don't treat commandments as commendments
