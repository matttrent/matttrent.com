### Chapter 4: A Russian Connection

The agents knew the penalty for taking risks when mistakes counted as heinous crimes

### Chapter 8: Explosions

in fact every nation that has attempted to build an atomic weapon in the half-century since the discovery of nuclear fission has succeeded on the first try

### Chapter 12: Peculiar Sovereignties

I never ran into anyone who was brighter than he was. But to be more original and profound I think you have to be more focussed.

### Chapter 16: Sailing Near the Wind

Instead of trying to derive the expected outcomes of these processes with complex mathematics, Ulam saw, it should be possible to follow a few thousand individual sample particles, selecting a range for each particle’s fate at each step of the way by throwing in a random number, and take the outcomes as an approximate answer—a useful estimate. This iterative process was something a computer could do

The two friends developed the mathematics together and named the procedure the Monte Carlo method

### Chapter 17: Getting Down to Business

In the new calculus of the atomic age, enthusiasm for using atomic weapons varied inversely with responsibility for doing so.

### Chapter 20: ‘Gung-ho for the Super’

Conant thought US reliance on atomic and potentially thermonuclear weapons “was sort of a Maginot Line psychology being pushed on us

how hydrogen bombs would change the military balance by making the attack still more powerful and the defense still less powerful

### Chapter 24: Mike

be unrealistic but let’s set it and not keep saying, Oh, we’ve got to slip it. Let’s target and try to make it go. That required some real good thinking—namely, what is it you’re trying to do in this test? Is it going to be weapon? Is it “proof of principle”? What’s it going to be
