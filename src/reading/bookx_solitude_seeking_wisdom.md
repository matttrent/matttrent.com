### Introduction The Call of Solitude

After six or seven weeks, without other people to help me maintain my identity, the facade of autonomous self-sufficiency started to crumble. Fear crept in as I awoke to how small and vulnerable I was in the face of an enormous and threatening universe

Of course the quality of the work must be excellent when you step outside the usual framework

Over and over when I’ve tried to arrange things ahead of time I’ve had to either give up or have watched my plans fall apart. But over and over, too, things have worked out at the last minute in unexpected ways. Why do I still resist living by faith? I’m seriously stressing myself and it doesn’t seem to do much good. But perhaps the last-minute miracles won’t happen if I stop the preparatory work

### February 2001

Always risky to extrapolate from what you do know to what you don’t

### March 2001

I want to explore the anxiety I so often feel. It’s deep and poisons my life. I’ve seen over and over that things work out — not always as I’d planned, sometimes much better — yet still I look ahead with fear. Instead of relaxing into life, I’m often needlessly tense and worried

Sometimes time stretches on forever, usually when there is physical, emotional, or spiritual pain, otherwise the days zoom by

The challenge, of course, is to give thanks no matter what the circumstance, but sometimes that’s not so easy to do.

Basic survival requires a competent ego, but it has usurped control and is no longer a servant/friend of my whole being — which includes spirit, intuition, and love, and finds joy and peace through relaxing into the flow of existence. The ego wants to dominate, and in order to justify its overbearing presence, it creates looming illusory problems to solve.

Anxiety is part of our human condition, and we need to learn to treat it as an old friend, or least a familiar acquaintance. Many therapists say to do something to avoid anxiety, but in such endless activity much of our experience — joyful and painful — is lost. Seems like a hard bargain

### Interlude: On Journaling and Storytelling

writing tended to pull me out of the present moment and mute the intensity of experience — unless I remained clearly aware of the actual process of writing. Remaining silent was often preferable

it was not actual journaling that became distracting, but thinking beforehand about what I would write and mentally describing to myself what I was seeing and feeling

Any story we create — if we actually believe it and take it as our own — will limit our freedom to be who we are not in that new story

whenever we find ourselves entering narcissistic territory, we can recognize the terrain without searching immediately for an alternative

Despite differences in theology, moral orientation, and self-discipline, the man in that pedestrian tale may have more in common with St. Augustine and his surrender of personal agency to Divine Will than with the stereotypical self-oriented striving of modern culture’s secular hero.

My goal in the wilderness was not to conquer either the external world or my own inner nature, but to give up the illusion of ownership and control and to experience myself as part of the ebb and flow of something greater than individual ego. But the goal of attaining enlightenment was elusive — except when it was not. Through a shift in consciousness, my quest came to an end as I realized there was nowhere to go and nothing to get

### April 2001

It isn’t actually non-doing that generates anxiety, but rather fretting about doing or not doing

I recall, as from a place and time far away and half forgotten, my grandiose intention in coming here: to explore, through living, the physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual effects of deep wilderness solitude. Now my world has shrunk to this small beach and stretch of water; to what I’ll eat for lunch; to hooking up the stove and rain barrel; to the pain in my shoulders, hands, and teeth

If I have a stake — set expectations — I’m not truly open to discovery. I must trust not only the physical process, but the emotional and spiritual ones as well

I suspect I’m keeping some strong feelings at bay by staying busy

“Where there is no joy there can be no courage; and without courage all the other virtues are useless.” Where is my joy?

And now I feel cut off, lonely, and frightened. Edging through the days and wondering if I’ll make it. I need to commit myself to stop being unhappy and to stop sounding like a broken record. Life will be what it is.

What are these lacks of color? Grey, black, and silver are not enough. A rich monochrome spectrum reaches out from that deep distance: close hills are dark and solid, and each line behind lighter in mass and tone

At Buddhist meditation retreats students are urged to sleep as little as possible to develop more continuous awareness. We often tend to escape from consciousness into sleep or into activity and substances. Here, I’m becoming clearer that there is no “away” where I can go

It’s not that thinking is bad, but it becomes addictive and will not end my suffering as I expect it to

What is this core I’m knotted around? What painful wound am I protecting? I want nothing to touch me there — but rain, wind, cold, and Cat keep battering the walls I build. It may be shame that I’m weak or cowardly and not up to this experience. I feel I’m still in spiritual hiding, crouching out of the infinite eternal flow of existence; afraid to surrender to my fear and suffering, to vulnerability and death

To call fishing a sport is like calling gardening a pastime or church a social activity. On one level all three labels are accurate, but if it’s nothing more to you, you’ve missed the heart of the matter — the place where you are no longer only you but part of something greater

### Interlude: Method, Solitude, and Meditation

We are the sum of all the observations we make. When we refuse to acknowledge certain aspects of our lived experience simply because we cannot make rational sense of them, we impoverish our lives. Self-knowledge is vital to our understanding of the world and our place in it.

### June 2001

I often find it hard to let go of what might have been and stay with what actually is

### Interlude: A Glance at Other Solitaries

Shekhdar claims to have been disappointed to not directly experience the existence of God, but how could he? He kept his mind so full of trivial activity there was little possibility to notice God’s presence
