# bookx elon musk

One of the scariest meetings was when we needed to ask Elon for extra 2 weeks and more money to build another version of the Model S.  We put together a plan, stating how long things would take and what they would cost.  We told him that if wanted the car in 30 days it would require hiring some new people, and we presented him with a stack of resumes.  You don't tell Elon you can't do something.

He always said "Take it down to the physics".

Musk, though, approaches everything from the Platonic perspective.

I felt a bit like my grandmother.  She lived through the Great Depression and some real hard times.  Once you've been through that, it stays with you for a long time.  I'm not sure it ever leaves really.  So, I do feel joy now, but there's still that nagging feeling that it might all go away.

One of his biggest assets is he didn't start with a lot of resources.  He had to drive himself to build better things and make a real business out of it.

Coming up with true breakthrough ideas is much harder today than in the past, according to Cowen, because we've already mined the bulk of the big discoveries. -- _is that really true?_

You put these things together and the morph into something we've never seen before.  All of a sudden there is a wholesale change.  It's a step function.

I've learned that your basic intuition about things you don't know that much about isn't very good.  The way Elon talks about this is that you always need to start with the first principles of the probelm.  What are the physics of it?  How much time will it take?  How much will it cost?  How much cheaper can I make it?  There's this level of engineering and physics that you need to make judgements about what's possible and what's interesting.

He's willing to suffer some personal cost, and I think that makes his odds actually pretty good.

I don'k think we're doing a good job as a society deciding what things are really important to do.

I think we're not educating people in this kind of general way.  You should have a pretty broad engineering and scientific background.  You should have some leadership training and a bit of MBA training or knowledge of how to run things, organize stuff, and raise money.

When you're able to think about all of these disciplines together, you kind of think differently and can dream of much crazier things and how they might work.

Elon came to the conclusion early in his career that life is short.  If you really embrace this, it leave you with the obvious conclusion that you should be working as hard as you can.

None of these startups understand the objective.  The objective should be--what delivers fundamental value.  I think it's important to look at thigns from a standpoint of what is actually the best thing for the economy.  __or any other area you are studying__
