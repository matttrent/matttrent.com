# Daily Rituals

"Sooner or later," Pritchett writes, "the great men turn out to be all alike.  They never stop working.  They never lose a minute.  It's very depressing."

## W. H. Auden

>   Routine, in an intelligent man, is a sign of ambition.
>   
>   A modern stoic knows that the surest way to discipline passion is to
>   discipline time.

## Simone de Beauvoir

There was the presence only of essentials.  It was an uncluttered kind of life, as simplicity deliberately constructed so that she could do her work.

## Morton Feldman

It's a very good idea that after you write a little bit, sotp and then copy it.  Because while you're copying it, you're thinking about it, and it's giving you other ideas.

## Anthony Trollope

>   It was my practice to be at my table every morning by 5:30 AM; it was also my practice to allow myself no mercy.
>   
>   Three hours a day will produce as much as a man ought to write.

__If he completed a novel before his three hours were up, Trollope would take out a fresh sheet of paper and immediately begin the next one.__

## Thoman Mann

Anything that didn't come by noon would have to wait until the next day, so he forces himself to "clench the teeth and take one slow step at a time".

## Sigmund Freud

>   I cannot imagine life without work as really comfortable.

## Carl Jung

>   I've realized that somebody's who's tired and needs a rest, and goes on working all the same is a fool.
>   
>   These simple acts make man simple, and how difficult it is to be simple!

## Gertrude Stein

Stein confirm that she had never been able to write much more than half an hour a day--but added, "If you write half and hour a day it makes a lot of writing year by year".

## Erenst Hemmingway

>   You write until you come to a place where you still have your juice and know what will happen next and you stop and try to live trhough until the next day when you hit it again.

## Henry Miller

>   I don't believe in draining the reservoir, do you see?  I believe in getting up from the typewriter, away from it, while I still have things to say.

He stressed the importance of keeping regular hours in order to cultivate a daily creative rhythm.

## William Faulkner

>   I write when the spirit moves me and the spirit moves me every day.

## Haruki Murakami

>   Physical strength is as necessary as artistic sensitivity.

## Joyce Carol Oates

>   Even if I retain only a single page from a day's work, it _is_ a single page, and these pages add up.  I have acquired the reputation over the years of being prolix when in fact I am measured against people who simply don't work as hard or as long.

## Chuck Close

>   Inspiration is for amateurs.  The rest of us just show up and get to work.

## John Adams

>   My experience has been that most really serious creative peolpe I know have very, very routine and not particularly glamorous work habits.

## Steve Reich

>   If there's a little problem that comes up.  The best thing to do is just leave it and put your mind somewhere else, and not always but often the solution to that problem with bubble up spontaneously.

## Nicholson Baker

>   What I've found with daily routines is that the usful thing is to have one that feels new.  It can almost be arbitrary.

_How does this resolve itself with the goal of habit to fall to the background?_

## Immanuel Kant

Character, for Kant, is a rationally chosen way to organize one's life, based on years of varied experience--indeed, he believed that one does not really develop character until age 40.  And at the core of one's character, he thought, were maxims--a handful of essential rules for living that, once formulated, should be followed for the rest of one's life.

## William James

Put part of your life on autopilot; by forming good habits, he said, we can "free our minds to advance really interesting fields of action".

>   The great thing in education is to make our nervous system our ally instea of our enemy.

## George Gershwin

He was dismissive of inspiration, saying that if he waited for the muse he would compose at most three songs a year.  It was better to work every day.  "Like the pugilist," Gershwin said, "the songwriter must always keep in training."

## William Styron

Be regular and orderly in your life like a Bourgeois so that you may be violent and original in your work.
