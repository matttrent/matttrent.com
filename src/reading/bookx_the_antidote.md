## on trying too hard to be happy

For a civilization so fixed on achieving happiness, we seem remarkable incompenent at the task.  One of the best-known general findings of the 'science of happiness' has been the discover that the countless advantages of modern life have done so little to lift our collective mood.

For one thing, who said happiness is a valid goal in the first place?

"Ask yourself whether you are happy," observed the philosopher John Stuart Mill, "and you cease to be so".

The effort to try to feel happy is often precisely the thing that makes us miserable.

In order to be truly happy, we might actually need to be willing to experience negative emotions -- or, at the very least, to learn to stop running quite so hard from them.

All this _trying to make everything right_ is a big part of what's wrong.  Or, to quote [Allan] Watts, that "when you try to stay on the surface of the water, you sink; but when you try to sink, you float".

The "negative path" is about rejecting this dichotomy, and seeking instead the happiness that arises _through_ negativity.

Happiness involves paradoxes; that there is no way to tie up all the loose ends, however desparately we might want to.

If you try too hard--or, Wegner's studies suggest, if you are tired, stressed, depressed, attempting to multi-task, or otherwise suffering from 'mental load' -- metacognition will frequently go wrong.  The monitoring process will start to occupy more than its fair share of the limelight on the cognitive stage.  It will jump to the forefront of consciousness.

A person who has resolved to 'think positively' must constantly scan his or her mind for negative thoughts.

Messages that conflict with that sense of seld, therefore, are unsettling, and so we often reject them -- even if they happen to be positive, and even if the source of the message is ourselves.

## what would seneca do?

Healthy and happy people, research suggests, generally have a _less_ accurate, overly optimistic grasp of their true ability to influence events than do those woh are suffering from depression

Spending time and energy thinking about how well things could go, it has emerged, actually reduces most people's motivation to achieve them.  _Also, don't talk to others about them._  They seemed, subconsciously, to have confused visualising success with having already achieved it.

The ideal state of mind was tranquility, not the excitable cheer that positive thinkers usually seem to mean when they used the word 'happiness'.  And tranquility was to be achieved by cultivating the kind of calm indefference to one's circumstances.

__It's our _beliefs_ that really matter.__

>   "Things do not touch the soul.  Our perturbations come only from the opinion which is within."
>   -- Marcus Aurelius

In fact, it's a two-step procedure: between the outside event and the inside belief.

The positive thinker ends up being _less_ prepared, and _more_ acutely distressed, when things eventually happen that he can't persuade himself to believe are good.  (And such things will happen.)

One of the greatest enemies of human happiness is 'hedonic adaptation' -- the predictable and frustrating way in which any new source of pleasure we obtain switfty get relegated to the backdrop of our lives.

Consider the possibility that they might die tomorrow.  The practice will make you love them all the more, while simultaneously reducing the shock should that awful eventuality ever come to pass.

The premeditation of evils is an antidote to anxiety.

Like all forms of optimism, it requires maintenance.

But it is also true that, when they do go wrong, they'll almost certainly go _less_ wrong than you were fearing.

Confronting the worst-case scenario saps it of much of its anxiety-inducing power.  Happiness reached via positive thinking can be fleeting and brittle; visualization generates a vastly more dependable calm.

>   "Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress.  Saying to yourself allthe while, 'Is this the condition that I feared?'
>   -- Seneca

We habitually act as if our control over the world were much greater than it really is.

"Never have I trusted fortune", writes Seneca, "even when she seemed to be at peace.  All her generous bounties -- money, office, influence -- I deposited them where she could ask for them back without disturbing me."

It is essential to grasp a distinction here between acceptance and resignation.

If you accept that the universe is uncontrollable you're going to be a lot less anxious.

## the storm before the calm

At the root of all suffering, says the second of the 'four nobel truths' that define Buddhism, is attachment.  We develop the habits of clinging and aversion.

Most people who thought they were 'seeking happiness' were really running away from things of which they were barely aware.

Learning to view passing thoughts and feelings as if one were a spectator, not a participant.

Sounds and smells and tastes, after all, are just sounds and smells and tastes, but thougths, we tend to assume, are something much more important.

Who says you need to wait until you 'feel like' doing something in order to start doing it?  The problem, from this perspective, isn't that you don't feel motivated; it's that you imagine that you need to feel motivated.

The dailing rituals and working routinesof prolific artists and authors -- people who really do get a lot done -- very rarely include techniques for 'getting motivated' or 'feeling inspired'.  Quite the opposite: they tend to emphasize the mechanics of the working process, focusing not on generate the right mood, but on accomplishing certain physical actions, regardless of mood.

>   Inspiration is for amateurs.  The rest of us just show up and get to work.
>   -- Chuck Close

## goal crazy

"Lured into the destruction by their passion for goals".

His hypothesis was that the more they fixated on the endpoint -- a successful summiting of the mountain -- the more that goal became not just an external target but a part of their identities.  It would have become progressively more difficult for them to sacrifice their goal, despite accumulating evidence that it was becoming a suicidal one.

The negative evidence would be reinterpreted as a reason to invest _more_ effort and resources into the pursuit of the goal.

Faced with the anxiety of not knowing what the future holds, we invest ever more fiercely in our preferred vision of the future -- not because it will help us achieve it, but because it helps rid us of feelings of uncertainty in the present.

We fear the feeling of uncertainty to an extraordinary degree and we will go to extraordinary lengths, even fatal ones, to get rid of it.

In singling out one goal, or set of goals, and striving to meet it, you will invariably exert an effect on other, interlinked aspects of the thing you're trying to change.  Applied to the personal realm, it might mean obtaining your goals at the expense of ruining your life.

"When we try to pick out any thing by itself," the naturalist and philosopher John Muir observed, "we find it is hitched to everything else in the universe".

"The continued existence of complex interactive systems," Bateson argued, "depends upon preventing the maximization of any variable".

What made the difference, in the end, was a conversation with a friend who told him he was spending too much energy thinking about about the future.

Continue this over and over, moving in whatever direction feels right.

The more goals they set for themselves, the more stressed the felt -- even though 52% said that one of their goals was to reduce the amount of stress in their lives.

Adopt an unconventional approach to learning, an improvisational flexibility not merely about which route to take towards some predetermined objective, but also a willingness to change the destination itself.

Don't be guilded by thoughts of how wonderful the rewards migth be if you were spectacularly successful at any given next step.  Instead -- and there are distinct echoes, here, of the Stoic focus on the worst-case scenario, -- ask how big the loss would be if you failed.  So long as it is tolerable, that's all you need to know.

## who's there?

Even the person who fears that he or she may be being fooled about literally everything must know for sure that there is a 'him' or a 'her' who's being fooled.

Just because thinking is going on, that didn't mean Descartes was justified in concluding that thinking is being done by one particular thinking agent -- by an 'I'.

The voice judges and interprets reality, determines our emotional reactions, and chatters so constantly and loudly that we come to identify with it: we imagine that we _are_ the chattering stream of thinking.

Only a very thin line separates such 'insane' people from the rest of us.  The main difference is that, most of the time, we non-insane people manage to keep our constant mental chatter inaudible to others.

It's really quite tricky, when you try it, to think about right now.

Compulsive thinking is what we take to be the core of our being -- and yet compulsive thinking relies on our feeling dissatisfied.

We have all experienced something 'behind or underneath' thought, in those moments that thinking seems to temporarily fall away: when gpasping in awe at beautiful scenery, after intense physical activity, or while making love.

Without noticing that we're doing it, we treat the future as intrinsically more valuable than the present.

Rate your individual acts as good or bad.  Seek to perform as many good ones, and as few bad ones, as possible.

Helping other people is a far more reliable strategy for happiness than focusing soley on yourself.

Ducks bear no grudges.  People, with egos, do.

## the safety catch

If the most radical proponents of the 'negative path' are to be believed, in turning towards insecurity we may come to understand that security itself is a kind of illusion.

There might be something more fundamentally problematic about the goal of security; and that real happiness might depend on being willing to face, and to tolerate, insecurity and vulnerability.

__To love at all is to be vulnerable.__

The more you try to avoid suffering, the more you suffer, because smaller and more insignificant things begin to torture you, in proportion to your fear of being hurt.

Insecurity is the essential nature of reality -- and all our distress arises from trying to scramble to solid ground that doesn't exist.

Pursuing our desire of feeling security can lead us badly astray; and that vulnerability may be a precondition for the very things that bring the greatest happiness -- strong social relationships above all.

By elimination gods and the afterlife, the scientific picture of the universe seems to have sapped individual human lives of any meaning.  __Are we stuck, then, with the choice of living meaningless but scientifically truthful lives, or lives based on superstition and self-deception?__

No man steps in the same river twice.

To be secure means to isolate and fortiy the 'I', but it is just this feeling of being an isolated 'I' which makes me feel so lonely and afraid.

We do not actually understand that there is no security until we realize that this 'I' doesn't exist.

## the museum of failure

Perfectionism, at the bottom, is a fear-driven striving to avoid the experience of failure at all costs.

'Incremental theory' people are different.  Because they think of abilities as emerging through tackling challenges, the experience of failure has a completely different meaning for them: it's evidence that they stretched themselves to their current limit.  Among weightlifters, 'training to failure' isn't an admission of defeat -- it's a strategy.

The incremental mindset is one of the most likely to lead to sucess -- but a more profound point is that possessing and incremental outlook is a happier way to be, even if it _never_ results in any particularly outstanding success.  It allows you to abandon the stress and tiring struggle of perfectionism.

Failure meant a stripping away of the inessential.

## memento mori

>   The most wonderous thing in the world is that although, every day, innumerable creatures go into the abode of Death, still man thinks he is immortal.
>   -- Yudhisthira (Mahabharata)

Many of us manage to avoid all thoughts of our own mortality for months, even years, at a time.

The ideal of death, the fear of it, haunts the human animal like nothing else.

We are able to sustain this denial because we possess both a physical self and a symbolic one.  The symbolic self -- the one that exists in our minds -- is quite capable of convincing itself that it is immortal.

You don't _fail_ to think about your mortality.  Rather, your life is one relentless attempt to avoid doing so.

"Death is nothing to us, since when we are, death has not come, and when death has come, we are not."

"The fear of death is one of the most unjustified of all fears, for there's no risk of accident to one who's dead".

"People who are averse to death are not usually averse to unconsciousness".

Why do you fear the eternal oblivion of death if you don't look back with horror at the eternal oblivion before you were born?

Look at it like going to a really nice restaurant.  You take it as a fact that the meal isn't going to last forever.  Never mind if that's the way it suhold be, or whether you feel like you're owed more meal, or you resent the fact that the meal isn't eternal.  It's just the case that you have this one meal.  So it would make sense, wouldn't it, to try to suck the marrow out of it?

Remembering you are going to die is the best way that I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.  You are already naked.

___memento mori_, remember you shall die.__

Every hour wounds, and the last one kills.

Imagine you are eighty years old and then complete the sentences "I wish I'd spent more time on..." and "I wish I'd spent less time on..."

## negative capability

Sometimes the most valuable of all talents is to be able _not_ to seek resolution; to notice the craving for completeness or comfort and _not_ to feel compelled to follow where it leads.

The problem is that we have developed the habit of chronically overvaluing positivity and the skills of 'doing' in how we think about happiness, and that we chronically undervalue negativity and 'not-doing' skills, such as resting in uncertainty or getting friendly towards failure.

__Do you have a problem _right now_?__

>   A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent upon arriving.
>   -- Lao Tzu
