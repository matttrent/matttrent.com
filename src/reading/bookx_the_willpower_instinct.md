# The Willpower Instinct

## summary

Self-knowledge -- especially of how we find ourselves in willpower trouble -- is the foundation of self-control.

## I will, I won't, I want

3 sides to will power

- _I won't_ -- say no when you need to say now
- _I will_ -- say yes when you need to say yes
- _I want_ -- ability to remember what you really want

to exhert self-control you need to find your motivation when it matters

why it matters now

- self-control is
- a better predictor of academic succes than intelligence
- a stronger determinant of effective leadership than charisma
- more important to marital bliss than empathy

will-power based in the prefrontal cortex

- part of succeeding at your willpower challenge will be finding a way to take advantage, and not fight, primitive instincts

know thyself

- people who are more distracted are more likely to give into temptation
- when your mind is preoccupied, your impulses -- not long-term goals -- will guide your choices

track your choices

- for at least one day
- look back and analyize which decisions supported or undermined your goals
- keeping track of choices will reduce decisions made while distracted
- boosts willpower

train your brain for willpower

- meditation improves ability to meditate
- but much more: attention, focus, stress management, impulse control, self-awareness
- regular meditators have more grey matter in prefrontal cortex

## willpower instinct -- born to resist cheesecake

- self-control is a matter of physiology, not just psychology

flight or fight

- stress hormones released
- biological shift towards very high physical activity
- chemical changes that inhibit pre-frontal cortext, reducing impulse control
- high stres makes your more impulsive
