Rather, when famine, plague or war break out of our control, we feel that somebody must have screwed up, we set up a commission of inquiry, and promise ourselves that next time we’ll do better.

Sugar is now more dangerous than gunpowder.

And every technical problem has a technical solution.

If traditionally death was the speciality of priests and theologians, now the engineers are taking over.

life is generally divided into a learning period followed by a working period. When you live to be 150 that won’t do, especially in a world that is constantly being shaken by new technologies.

The physicist Max Planck famously said that science advances one funeral at a time.

A large part of our artistic creativity, our political commitment and our religious piety is fuelled by the fear of death.

Most people in ancient times rejected Epicureanism, but today it has become the default view. Scepticism about the afterlife drives humankind to seek not only immortality, but also earthly happiness.

Perhaps the key to happiness is neither the race nor the gold medal, but rather combining the right doses of excitement and tranquillity; but most of us tend to jump all the way from stress to boredom and back, remaining as discontented with one as with the other.

Such sensations are just ephemeral and meaningless vibrations. Even when we experience them, we don’t react to them with contentment; rather, we just crave for more.

With each passing year our tolerance for unpleasant sensations decreases, and our craving for pleasant sensations increases.

Yet there are no good answers to the question, ‘What would beings with a different kind of mind do with biotechnology?’

We sense that in such a world, our identity, our dreams and even our fears will be irrelevant, and we will have nothing more to contribute.

nobody knows where the brakes are.

If growth ever stops, the economy won’t settle down to some cosy equilibrium; it will fall to pieces. 

Given our past record and our current values, we are likely to reach out for bliss, divinity and immortality – even if it kills us.

Despite the technological hubris of these dreams, ideologically they are old news.

The future described in this chapter is merely the future of the past – i.e. a future based on the ideas and hopes that dominated the world for the last 300 years. The real future – i.e. a future born of the new ideas and hopes of the twenty-first century – might be completely different.
To understand all this we need to go back and investigate who Homo sapiens really is, how humanism became the dominant world religion and why attempting to fulfil the humanist dream is likely to cause its disintegration. This is the basic plan of the book.

No investigation of our divine future can ignore our own animal past, or our relations with other animals

Yet it may be better to call the last 70,000 years the Anthropocene epoch: the epoch of humanity.

archaic hunter-gatherers were probably animists: they believed that there was no essential gap separating humans from other animals.

Most of us automatically see animals as essentially different and inferior. 

The expulsion from Eden bears a striking resemblance to the Agricultural Revolution. Instead of allowing Adam to keep gathering wild fruits, an angry God condemns him ‘to eat bread by the sweat of your brow’.

The animals suffer greatly, yet they live on and multiply.

Rather, emotions are biochemical algorithms that are vital for the survival and reproduction of all mammals.

What we call sensations and emotions are in fact algorithms.

Animist religions had previously depicted the universe as a grand Chinese opera with a limitless cast of colourful actors. Elephants and oak trees, crocodiles and rivers, mountains and frogs, ghosts and fairies, angels and demons – each had a role in the cosmic opera. Theist religions rewrote the script, turning the universe into a bleak Ibsen drama with just two main characters: man and God. 

The gods, meanwhile, were given two related roles to play. Firstly, they explained what is so special about Sapiens and why humans should dominate and exploit all other organisms. 

Secondly, the gods had to mediate between humans and the ecosystem.

During the Agricultural Revolution humankind silenced animals and plants, and turned the animist grand opera into a dialogue between man and gods. During the Scientific Revolution humankind silenced the gods too. The world was now a one-man show.

Whereas the Agricultural Revolution gave rise to theist religions, the Scientific Revolution gave birth to humanist religions, in which humans replaced gods.

If there is no such spark, would there be any reason to continue assigning special value to human life even after computers surpass humans in intelligence and power? 

Scientists don’t know how a collection of electric brain signals creates subjective experiences. Even more crucially, they don’t know what could be the evolutionary benefit of such a phenomenon. 

The better we understand the brain, the more redundant the mind seems.

In the nineteenth century, scientists described brains and minds as if they were steam engines. Why steam engines? Because that was the leading technology of the day,

But if an artificial intelligence self-reports that it is conscious, should we just believe it?

Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviours. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness.

Since we aren’t familiar with any algorithm that requires consciousness, anything an animal does can be seen as the product of non-conscious algorithms rather than of conscious memories and plans. 

In fact, however, the lesson is just the opposite. The story demonstrates that by humanising animals we usually underestimate animal cognition and ignore the unique abilities of other creatures.

Yet since these triumphs actually result from mass cooperation, it is far less clear why they should make us revere individual humans.

Research indicates that Sapiens just can’t have intimate relations (whether hostile or amorous) with more than 150 individuals.22 Whatever enables humans to organise mass-cooperation networks, it isn’t intimate relations.

All large-scale human cooperation is ultimately based on our belief in imagined orders.

However, there is a third level of reality: the intersubjective level. Intersubjective entities depend on communication among many humans rather than on the beliefs and feelings of individual humans.

The basic abilities of individual humans have not changed much since the Stone Age. But the web of stories has grown from strength to strength, thereby pushing history from the Stone Age to the Silicon Age.

This was one of the main reasons why in Sumer, like everywhere else around the world, human cooperation networks could not grow much even thousands of years after the Agricultural Revolution.

This obstacle was finally removed about 5,000 years ago, when the Sumerians invented both writing and money.

Writing has thus enabled humans to organise entire societies in an algorithmic fashion.

Really powerful human organisations – such as pharaonic Egypt, communist China, the European empires and the modern school system – are not necessarily clear-sighted. Much of their power rests on their ability to force their fictional beliefs on a submissive reality.

### 4: The Storytellers

No matter how mistaken the biblical world view was, it provided a better basis for large-scale human cooperation.

History isn’t a single narrative, but thousands of alternative narratives. Whenever we choose to tell one, we are also choosing to silence others.

Human cooperative networks usually judge themselves by yardsticks of their own invention, and not surprisingly, they often give themselves high marks. In particular, human networks built in the name of imaginary entities such as gods, nations and corporations normally judge their success from the viewpoint of the imaginary entity. A religion is successful if it follows divine commandments to the letter; a nation is glorious if it promotes the national interest; and a corporation thrives if it makes a lot of money.

Corporations, money and nations exist only in our imagination. We invented them to serve us; how come we find ourselves sacrificing our lives in their service

### 5: The Odd Couple

Thanks to computers and bioengineering, the difference between fiction and reality will blur, as people reshape reality to match their pet fictions

Religion is anything that confers superhuman legitimacy on human social structures. It legitimises human norms and values by arguing that they reflect superhuman laws

Such journeys are fundamentally different from religions, because religions seek to cement the worldly order whereas spirituality seeks to escape it

From a historical perspective, the spiritual journey is always tragic, for it is a lonely path fit for individuals rather than for entire societies

Scientists study how the world functions, but there is no scientific method for determining how humans ought to behave. Science tells us that humans cannot survive without oxygen. However, is it okay to execute criminals by asphyxiation? Science doesn’t know how to answer such a question. Only religions provide us with the necessary guidance

Though science indeed deals only with facts, religion never confines itself to ethical judgements. Religion cannot provide us with any practical guidance unless it makes some factual claims too, and here it may well collide with science. The most important segments of many religious dogmas are not their ethical principles, but rather factual statements such as ‘God exists

Religions have the nagging tendency to turn factual statements into ethical judgements, thereby creating terrible confusion and obfuscating what should have been relatively simple debates

It would accordingly be far more correct to view modern history as the process of formulating a deal between science and one particular religion – namely, humanism. Modern society believes in humanist dogmas, and uses science not in order to question these dogmas, but rather in order to implement them

### 6: The Modern Covenant

Yet in fact modernity is a surprisingly simple deal. The entire contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.

The modern world does not believe in purpose, only in cause. If modernity has a motto, it is ‘shit happens’.

### 9: The Great Decoupling

The most important question in twenty-first-century economics may well be what to do with all the superfluous people
