### The Dark-Born Magic

her memoir in a rare book collection at York University (Seven Years Solitary was published in 1957, just a year after her release

### 1. All Together Now

the shift we’re undergoing is analogous to the transition at the turn of the previous century—the Industrial Revolution. “At that point,” he explained, “you saw massive capital infrastructure being built for iron, for oil, for copper. But it’s no longer about supply economies of scale—it’s demand economies of scale

As optimistic as a platform-based city might sound, I wonder if this shift will undo an essential quality of city living. For didn’t some of us move to the city in the first place to become anonymous, to be uncounted, to go solo amidst a disorganized crowd—and thus, to find ourselves, lest we be informed too much by the findings of others

Meanwhile, if I covet a little alone time, if I detach without permission from that great heaving crowd, I am presumed to be a lost person

Solitude has become a resource.
Like all resources, it can be harvested and hoarded, taken up by powerful forces without permission or inquiry, and then transformed into private wealth, until the fields of empty space we once took for granted first dwindle, then disappear. Ultimately, we lose the capacity to develop a rich interior life like Dr. Bone’s.

True solitude—as opposed to the failed solitude that we call loneliness—is a fertile state, yet one we have a hard time accessing

### 2. What Is Solitude For?

Now, as we pack our lives with digital company along with the flesh-and-blood sort, we reach a threshold after which more “contact” creates only an odd kind of loneliness, a crowd-sickness. We groom and get groomed but receive diminishing returns and, despite constantly feeding on social fuel, we remain unsatisfied

It seems that becoming the most connected humans in history is no guarantee against isolation

solitude enhances one’s mental freedom, unshackling us by minimizing the intrusive self-consciousness that the presence of others inevitably produces

To take advantage of the opportunities afforded by solitude, a person must be able to turn a basically terrifying state of being into a productive one

These, then, are solitude’s uses: new ideas; an understanding of the self; and closeness to others

### 3. The Wandering Mind

The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honours the servant and has forgotten the gift

The need for periods of withdrawal and solitude,” Mellor writes, “are no longer acknowledged as a means of facilitating intellectual advances.” Although every fundamental shift in physics has required a good dose of solitude, “reticence and silence seem to have no place in the modern research agenda.”43 Peter Higgs, the Nobel Prize–winning godfather of the Hadron Collider, backs Mellor up, saying his trailblazing work would be impossible today because the peace and solitude he enjoyed in the 1960s has vanished.44

“If our mode of life leaves us feeling empty sometimes,” she tells me, “it may be because we aren’t left to our own devices, we aren’t allowed to mull things over. We’re deprived of that sense of meaning and happiness that mind wandering can produce

An annoying truth about daydreaming is that it takes practice to get good at it. And we are sorely out of practice

When Bertrand Russell wrote “In Praise of Idleness” he noted, “The wise use of leisure, it must be conceded, is a product of civilization and education.”52 This notion that there is a “wise use of leisure” may be a surprise to us.

### 4. Daydream Destroyers

What’s at risk is our ability to turn the meandering mind toward a proper, patient reverie—to steer our drifting curiosity away from digital titillation, away from addictive, nihilistic ludic loops and the attractions of sociability, toward a solitude where it could—who knows?—stumble upon uncharted territory

But too often we assume that bouts of sustained daydreaming are not for us ordinary folk. Too often we allow ourselves to be absorbed, instead, by anxious preoccupations that have been fed to us by others

Choosing a mental solitude, then, is a disruptive act, a true sabotage of the schemes of ludic loop engineers and social media barons. Choosing solitude is a gorgeous waste
