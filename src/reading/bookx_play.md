# Play

## Take your play history

Find that joy from the past and you are halfway to learning how to creat it again in your present life.  [...] create a general mental picture of your play attitudes and color them with emotion-laden scenes.

Start this exercise by spending some time thinking about what you did as a child that really got you excited, that really gave you joy.  

- Was it reading comic books?
- Building a tree house?
- Making stuff with Mom and Dad?
- Did you like doing things with other people, or in solitary? Or both?

Try to remember the feeling that you had, and recapture it.  As part of this rememberence, if visual images spring to your mind's eye, recapture them, let your associations to them flow.  To what or to who do you attach your unalloyed feelings?

Some initial questions:

- When have you felt free to do and be what you choose?
- Is it part of your life now?  If not, why not?
- What do you feel stands in the way of your achieving some times of personal freedom?
- Are you now able to feel that what engages you most fully and almost 
  effortless?  If not, can you recall when you were able to experience such times?  Describe.  Imaging settings that allow that sort of engagement.
- Search you memory for those times in your life when you have been at your best. (These are usually authentic play times, and give clues as to where to go for currente play experiences.)
- What have been the impediments to play in your life?
- How and why did some kinds of play disappear from your repertoire?
- Have you discovered ways of reinitiating lost play that work for you now in your life?
- Are you able to imagine and feel that the things you most desire and enjoy are really the things that you ought to have?  Why so, or why not?
- How free are you now as you play with your spouse or with your family? Or do you treat them as an extension of a dutiful responsibility?

## Expose yourself to play

People begin to close themselves off to play when they start to feel that they should always be serious, always be productive.

## Give yourself permission to be playful, to be a beginner

Probably the biggest roadblock to play for adults is the worry that they will look silly, undignified, or dumb if they allow themselves to truly play.  If someone has spent his life worried about always appearing respectable, competent, and knowledgeable, it can be hard to let go sometimes and become physically and emotionally free.

## Fun is your North Star, but you don't always have to head north

The trick is, of course, that some of the really transforming acts of play aren't purely fun.

## Be active

One of the quickest ways to jump-start play is to do something physical.  Just move.

## Free yourself from fear

Fear and play cannot go together.  Take a look at your environment and look where you are unsafe.  Recognize if your body is tight or tense in certain situations?

## Nourish your mode of play, and be with the people who nourish it, too

A lack of play shuold be treated like a malnutrition -- it's a health risk to your body and mind.  Be aware of play killers.
