### 1. The Complacent Class and Its Dangers

Americans are in fact working much harder than before to postpone change, or to avoid it altogether, and that is true whether we’re talking

about corporate competition, changing residences or jobs, or building things

These people might in the abstract like some things to change, they might even consider themselves progressive or even radical politically, but in fact they have lost the capacity to imagine or embrace a world where things do change rapidly for most if not all people

Yet in the 1960s and 1970s, not only did riots and bombings happen, but large numbers of influential intellectuals endorsed them, defended them, and maybe led them to some degree

Americans are less likely to switch jobs, less likely to move around the country, and, on a given day, less likely to go outside the house at all

Still, what has been lost is the ability to imagine an entirely different world and physical setting altogether, and the broader opportunities for social and economic advancement that would entail

The passenger train network is not growing, and bus lines are being shut down, both reflections of America’s decreasing interest in mastering travel and mobility across physical space

Urban progress is less transformational and more a matter of making more neighborhoods look and act like the nicer neighborhoods—namely gentrification

I argue that the physical world matters no less today, but we are in denial about its power and relevance. We seek to control it, to hold it steady, and to marginalize it ideologically by worshipping Silicon Valley and elevating the value and power of information

They wouldn’t be impressed at all, would they? They thought that we’d actually be doing this kind of thing by now. Not just figuring out more sophisticated ways to simulate it

So many features of the country became nicer, safer, and more peaceful, but as an unintended side effect, a lot of the barriers to advancement and innovation were raised

America has been trying to run a new industrial revolution with a limited number of engines while checking potential losses for the well-off and upper middle class

America declines in the sense that it is losing the ability to regenerate itself in the ways it did previously

Paradoxically, Americans can use innovative, ever more efficient information technology to slow down the change in many parts of life and to become more rather than less settled

there has been a fundamental shift of societal energy away from building a new and freer world and toward rearranging the pieces in the world we already have. There was something to be said for less-compatible, more challenge-laden accidental pairings with all their conflicts and messy resolutions

Toward this end, although the American legal system has allowed police to place quite severe restrictions on rights of public assembly, the demand for peace and calm and safety is so high that this is barely a public issue at all,

The share of Americans under thirty who own a business has fallen by about 65 percent since the 1980s

Contrary to common impressions, America is creating start-ups at lower rates each decade, and a smaller percentage of those start-ups is rising to prominence

We may not welcome all of the fairly radical changes that are to come sooner or later, but we’re postponing having to deal with them in favor of short-term comforts.

### 2. Why Have Americans Stopped Moving, or Is Your Hometown Really So Special?

The interstate migration rate has fallen 51 percent below its 1948–1971 average, and that number has been falling steadily since the mid-1980s
