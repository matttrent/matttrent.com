### 1 Caesar's World

Internally stable, the Roman Republic was able to devote itself to waging war on a scale and with a relentlessness unmatched by any rival

### 2 Caesar's childhood

If a family had more than one daughter, in official contexts their name was followed by a number to distinguish them

Dignitas was the sober bearing that displayed openly the importance and responsibility of a man and so commanded respect

Pietas embraced not merely respect for the gods, but for family and parents, and the law and traditions of the Republic. Virtus had strongly military overtones, embracing not simply physical bravery, but confidence, moral courage and the skills required by both soldier and commander

### 3 The First Dictator

The Romans openly stressed the great part played by luck in all human activities, especially warfare, and - anticipating Napoleon - believed that being lucky was one of the most important virtues of a general

### 8 Consul

With hindsight many would see 60 Bc as the year when the disease infecting the Republic became terminal

### 10 Migrants and Mercenaries:The first campaigns, 58 Bc

A crisis could also be an opportunity

### 11 `The Bravest of the Gaulish Peoples': The Belgae, 57 BC

His personal example was vital in encouraging the soldiers to meet his standards. Caesar led the column on training marches and in the field, sometimes on horseback, but more often on foot, just like the ordinary legionaries. It was a gesture intended to show them that he was not expecting them to do anything he would not do himself

### 12 Politics and War: The Conference of Luca

Whenever he felt that it was in his interest, Caesar was utterly ruthless

### 13 `Over the Waters': The British and German Expeditions, 55-54 BC

They came from an older tradition of warfare, which celebrated the personal prowess and heroism of individual warriors

### 14 Rebellion, Disaster and Vengeance

no large Gallic army could have operated at this season - in 57 BC the great Belgic army had even been forced to disperse when it ran out of food in the summer months. Only the organised supply system supporting the Roman army made this possible

three independent columns, each of which began clearing a route into tribal territory, constructing bridges and causeways as necessary. Such was the engineering skill of the legions that there were few places where they could not go if they were led with determination

### 15 The Man and the Hour: Vercingetorix and the Great Revolt, 52 BC

All of them were gifted soldiers who won great battlefield victories, but each realised that this was not enough without effective diplomacy and competent administration

### 16 `All Gaul is Conquered'

Caesar was entirely pragmatic - effectively amoral - in his use of clemency or massacre and atrocity

### 18 Blitzkrieg: Italy and Spain, Winter-Autumn, 49 BC

Crassus had boasted that only a man who could raise an army from his own resources could truly call himself rich

### 19 Macedonia, November 49-August 48 BC

In a frightening display of their discipline, Caesar's veterans halted, calmly redressed their ranks and then came on again in good order

### 21 Africa, September 47-June 46 BC

When the Civil War began his opponents had been wrong to think that Caesar would not fight, and then mistaken to believe that the greater resources under their control meant that their victory was assured

### 23 The Ides of March

For him the nature of public life had changed and now consisted almost entirely of dutiful effort, for all the men with whom he had once competed for supremacy - Crassus and Pompey most of all, but also Catulus, Cato and even Bibulus and their generation - had gone

A group of magistrates and former magistrates began to lift the byre on which the body was laid, for it was intended to carry it to a spot next to his daughter's tomb on the Campus Martins and cremate it there. The angry crowd would have none of this. Just as their hero Clodius had been burnt in the Senate House, so Caesar would also be cremated inside the city, in the Forum at its very heart
