### Season of the Brown Hyena

the social world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense, but rather is simply one model of reality, the consequence of one set of intellectual and spiritual choices that our particular cultural lineage made, however successfully, many generations ago

Fully 80 percent of the world’s population communicates with one of just eighty-three languages

The real threat to humanity,” Pinker writes, “comes from totalizing ideologies and the denial of human rights, rather than curiosity about nature and nurture

Science is only one way of knowing, and its purpose is not to generate absolute truths but rather to inspire better and better ways of thinking about phenomena

It follows, as these lectures will suggest, that the myriad of cultures of the world are not failed attempts at modernity, let alone failed attempts to be us. They are unique expressions of the human imagination and heart, unique answers to a fundamental question: What does it mean to be human and alive

the distribution determined not by the hunter but by the owner of the arrow. San men are always giving each other gifts of arrows. The arrow, with its tip of bone, its elegant shaft, its perfect blend of poison, represents the highest achievement of San technology. But its power lies in the realm of the social, for each exchange of arrows establishes bonds of reciprocity that forge the solidarity of San lives. To refuse a gift is an act of hostility. To accept is to acknowledge both a connection and an obligation

Our entire existential experience as a species over the past 50,000 years may be distilled into two words: how and why. These are the departure points for all inquiry, the slivers of insight around which cultures have crystallized.

### The Wayfinders

As Nainoa told me, it was one thing to know what to look for, these clues and signs and indications; it was quite another to pull it altogether and confront in the moment the ever-changing power and reality of the sea

The science and art of navigation is holistic. The navigator must process an endless flow of data, intuitions and insights derived from observation and the dynamic rhythms and interactions

You only know where you are by knowing precisely where you have been and how you got to where you are

Malinowski turned everything upside down, challenging conventional ideas about the nature of wealth, and the purpose and meaning of exchange

### Peoples of the Anaconda

He is like a modern engineer who enters the depths of a nuclear reactor to renew the entire cosmic order.

All of these ideas and restrictions create, as anthropologist Kaj Arhem has written, what is essentially a land management plan inspired by myth

White people, Ricardo told me, see with their eyes, but the Barasana see with their minds

### Sacred Geography

The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honours the servant and has forgotten the gift.” — Albert Einstein

We accept it as normal that people who have never been on the land, who have no history or connection to the country, may legally secure the right to come in and by the very nature of their enterprises leave in their wake a cultural and physical landscape utterly transformed and desecrated

The cost of destroying a natural asset, or its inherent worth if left intact, has no metric in the economic calculations that support the industrialization of the wild

the infinite and the impossible, the innocent and the profane, the sacred and the sordid, all of which represent unique dreams of the earth

During the Renaissance and well into the Enlightenment, in our quest for personal freedom, we in the European tradition liberated the human mind from the tyranny of absolute faith, even as we freed the individual from the collective, which was the sociological equivalent of splitting the atom. And, in doing so, we also abandoned many of our intuitions for myth, magic, mysticism, and, perhaps most importantly, metaphor

Phenomena that could not be positively observed and measured could not exist

For several centuries the rational mind has been ascendant, even though science, its finest expression, can still in all its brilliance only answer the question how, but never come close to addressing the ultimate question: why

A child raised to believe that a mountain is the abode of a protective spirit will be a profoundly different human being from a youth brought up to believe that a mountain is an inert mass of rock ready to be mined

They refer to these periodic wanderings as threads, with the notion that over time a community lays down a protective cloak upon the earth

It is the very realm of the ancestors, a parallel universe where the ordinary laws of time, space, and motion do not apply, where past, future, and present merge into one. It is a place Europeans can only approximate in sleep

Imagine for a moment if all the genius and intellect of all the generations that have come before you had been concentrated on a single set of tasks, focused exclusively on knowing a particular piece of ground, not only the plants and animals but every ecological, climatic, geographic detail, the pulse of every sentient creature, the rhythm of every breath of wind, the patterns of every season

To the contrary, the entire logos of the Dreaming is stasis, constancy, balance, and consistency. The entire purpose of humanity is not to improve anything

### Century of the Wind

Along the way we invented ten thousand different ways of being

We have this conceit in the West that while we have been celebrating and developing technological wizardry, somehow the other peoples of the world have been static and intellectually idle. Nothing could be further from the truth.

We have this idea that these indigenous peoples, these distant others, quaint and colourful though they may be, are somehow destined to fade away, as if by natural law, as if they are failed attempts at being modern, failed attempts at being us

if human beings are the agents of cultural destruction, we can also be the facilitators of cultural survival

Anyone who thinks they alone can change the world,” Peter Matthiessen once wrote, “is both wrong and dangerous.

A lama once told me that Western science and efficiency has made a major contribution to minor needs

the tendency of human beings to cling to the cruel illusion of their own permanence and centrality, their isolation and separation from the stream of universal existence

The Buddhists spend their time getting prepared for a moment that we spend most of our lives pretending does not exist, which is death

BEFORE SHE DIED , anthropologist Margaret Mead spoke of her singular fear that, as we drift toward a more homogenous world, we are laying the foundations of a blandly amorphous and singularly generic modern culture that will have no rivals

Her nightmare was the possibility that we might wake up one day and not even remember what had been lost

these accomplishments do not make the Western paradigm exceptional or suggest in any way that it has or ought to have a monopoly on the path to the future

Our way of life, inspired in so many ways, is not the paragon of humanity’s potential. Once we look through the anthropological lens and see, perhaps for the first time, that all cultures have unique attributes that reflect choices made over generations, it becomes absolutely clear that there is no universal progression in the lives and destiny of human beings. Were societies to be ranked on the basis of technological prowess, the Western scientific experiment, radiant and brilliant, would no doubt come out on top. But if the criteria of excellence shifted, for example to the capacity to thrive in a truly sustainable manner, with a true reverence and appreciation for the earth, the Western paradigm would fail. If the imperatives driving the highest aspirations of our species were to be the power of faith, the reach of spiritual intuition, the philosophical generosity to recognize the varieties of religious longing, then our dogmatic conclusions would again be found wanting

Were I to distill a single message from these Massey Lectures it would be that culture is not trivial. It is not decoration or artifice, the songs we sing or even the prayers we chant. It is a blanket of comfort that gives meaning to lives. It is a body of knowledge that allows the individual to make sense out of the infinite sensations of consciousness, to find meaning and order in a universe that ultimately has neither

Our economic models are projections and arrows when they should be circles. To define perpetual growth on a finite planet as the sole measure of economic well-being is to engage in a form of slow collective suicide
