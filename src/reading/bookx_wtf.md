### 

The magical technologies of today—and choices we’ve already made, decades ago, about what we value as a society—are leading us down a path with complex contingencies, unseen dangers, and decisions that we don’t even know we are making

Andy McAfee, coauthor of The Second Machine Age, put his finger on the consequence of failing to do so while talking with me over breakfast about the risks of AI taking over from humans: “The people will rise up before the machines do.”

Train yourself to recognize when you are looking at the map instead of at the road

Your map should be an aid to seeing, not a replacement for it. If you know a turn is coming up, you can be on the lookout for it. If it doesn’t come when you expect, perhaps you are on the wrong road

I didn’t predict the future. I drew a map of the present that identified the forces shaping the technology and business landscape

In the end, both web browsers and web servers turned out to be commodities, and value moved up the stack to services delivered over the true web platform.

A lot depends not just on how much data you have, of course, but how able you are to make sense of it. There Google, Tesla, and Uber have a big edge on traditional auto companies.

The notion of the Internet as an operating system for the next generation of applications had taken me a long way

Reinventing Discovery

In his magnificent history of the origins of modern computing, Turing’s Cathedral, George Dyson notes that some of the earliest thinkers about digital computing realized that the spread of “codes”—that is, programs—from computer to computer is akin to the spread of viruses

There is usually a paradigmatic company or group of companies that best exemplifies the next wave of technology. “Unpacking” the lessons of that company can help you draw your map of the future.

Today two of the companies that teach us the most about the trends shaping the future are Uber and its rival Lyft.

Rather than mapping a single company, I’d mapped what I thought of as the key principles of the new software business model and the ecosystem of the companies that best exemplified those principles

Matt Cohler, an early Facebook employee turned venture capitalist who became an early investor in Uber, noted that the smartphone is becoming “a remote control for real life.” Uber and Lyft drive home the notion that the Internet is no longer just something that provides access to media content, but instead unlocks real-world services

Passengers Who Expect Transportation On Demand. Much as Michael Schrage outlined in Who Do You Want Your Customers to Become?, Uber and Lyft are asking their consumers to become the kind of people who expect a car to be available as easily as they had previously come to expect access to online content. They are asking them to redraw their map of how the world works.

A Platform, Not Just a Company. A traditional business that wants to grow must hire people, invest in plants and equipment, and build out a management hierarchy

Distributed solar power generation, electric vehicles, and other signs of the transition from carbon-based energy to renewables seem like they are a bit out of the frame—or are they? After all, rooftop solar shares many of the distributed network characteristics of on-demand companies like Uber and Airbnb.

When making sense of the future, think in terms of gravitational cores, not hard boundaries. Just as the sun’s gravity well reaches out beyond the orbit of Pluto and encompasses not just the planets in the ecliptic but comets and planetoids with eccentric orbits, so too the forces shaping the future all have a gravitational core and a gradually attenuating influence. And just as the solar system has multiple gravitational subsystems, where the draw of the local giant keeps its own satellites in tow while all still partake in the larger dance, these interpenetrating trends influence each other and converge.

Replacing Materials with Information. Giving physical assets a digital footprint allows them to be managed much more like information assets

We replace materials with math,” Saul told me, describing how the essence of many of his projects is computational design, understanding the nature of shapes and materials and computing how to use them more efficiently.

Replacing materials with information” is a more powerful formulation than “replacing ownership with access.

Networked Marketplace Platforms

On Demand

Managed by Algorithm

Augmented Workers

When trying to map the future, remember that the territory is not an idealized landscape, but a real one, full of contradiction

When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is. . . . Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it. . . . Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.”

Camp and Kalanick also realized a key payment innovation that went even beyond Amazon’s 1-Click shopping: They realized that in a world infused with connected sensors, the very act of consuming a service could trigger payment. An app such as Uber knows when the ride begins and when it ends, calculates the cost in real time, and charges the stored credit card as soon as the ride is over. This innovation has still not entirely been grasped by others who could put it to use

Truly disruptive new services don’t just digitize the familiar. They do away with it.

This is a key lesson for every entrepreneur. Ask yourself: What is unthinkable?
And if, like Tony Fadell, you aren’t ready to push past that boundary of unthinkability because you believe the market isn’t ready, you can still prepare

While Foursquare tried to persuade users to adopt a new social behavior, Uber used the same capabilities to turbocharge an antiquated application that was just waiting to be brought into the twenty-first century

Uber is a $3.5 billion lesson in building for how the world *should* work instead of optimizing for how the world *does* work

Real breakthroughs come when an entrepreneur doesn’t just use new technology to duplicate what went before or to fine-tune the way the world works now, but to reimagine how it ought to work.

The TLPA estimates that the industry employs a total of 350,000 people, which works out to approximately two jobs per taxicab

These firms thus use technology to eliminate the jobs of what used to be an enormous hierarchy of managers (or a hierarchy of individual firms acting as suppliers), replacing them with a relatively flat network managed by algorithms, network-based reputation systems, and marketplace dynamics

Flex, Amazon’s network of on-demand delivery drivers, might well be larger than Lyft by 2018

It is also the opposite of what happens in old-style firms, where concentration of power often led to a smaller set of goods and services at higher prices.

Networks often turn out to be two-sided marketplaces, in which one party pays for access to the other, trading money for attention

marketplace providers must tread carefully, because ultimately, the health of the entire ecosystem must be their concern

It’s a big mistake,” he said, “for Twitter to shut down its ecosystem before someone in it invents their real business model.”

Over time, as networks reach monopoly or near-monopoly status, they must wrestle with the issue of how to create more value than they capture—how much value to take out of the ecosystem, versus how much they must leave for other players in order for the marketplace to continue to thrive

Even though the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative programs and techniques, no single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effective is the approach to programming, a philosophy of using the computer. Although that philosophy can’t be written down in a single sentence, at its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves.” The Internet also had a communications-oriented architecture, in which “small pieces loosely joined

In one of the early classics of systems engineering, Systemantics, John Gall wrote, “A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over beginning with a working simple system.

The coordination is all in the design of the system itself.

Doing digital isn’t the same as being digital.”

In the digital era, an online service and the organization that produces and manages it must become inseparable.

The long Internet boom of the past decade can be traced back to Amazon’s strategic decision to rebuild its own infrastructure and then open that infrastructure to the world. It isn’t just startups either

I started out as a retailer. That’s a really low-margin business. There’s no way this can be worse for me. Microsoft and Google have very high margins. This is always going to be a worse business for them

the company, famous for its focus on the customer, starts with a press release that describes what the finished product does and why

Then they write a “Frequently Asked Questions” document. They create mock-ups and other ways of defining the customer experience. They go so far as to write an actual user manual, describing how to use the product. Only then is the actual product green-lighted

The small teams are also a part of this approach. As is the design of a single, clearly-defined “fitness function” for each team (the one thing it promises to deliver, that can be measured and continuously improved).

Jeff was really asking for more effective, close communication within teams, coupled with highly structured communication between teams, mirroring the highly structured communication that makes it possible for modern Internet applications to work so well. He was arguing against the kind of backdoor communication that leads to messy workarounds that, over time, break under their own weight

Jeff “wanted rich discussion up front leading to Decision Time and then highly structured communication during Execution Time

Amazon does a better job of creating these kinds of mechanisms for its corporate values than any other company I’ve seen,” Kim added. “And it starts from first principles (values) more than other companies as well.”

This approach was also part of the revolution in warfare developed by General Stanley McChrystal in Afghanistan in response to the rapidly changing conditions on the ground there

That is, understand our shared objective, and use your best judgment about how to achieve it

This outcome-focused, outside-in approach means that, effectively, a team is promising a result, not how they will achieve it

From the point of view of the company offering an online service, software has gone from being a thing to a process, and ultimately, a series of business workflows

And those two groups typically didn’t talk to each other, leading to unforeseen problems once the software was actually deployed at scale.
DevOps is a way of seeing the entire software life cycle as analogous to the lean manufacturing processes that Toyota had identified for manufacturing

Often, when new technology is first deployed, it amplifies the worst features of the old way of doing business. Only gradually do individuals and organizations realize, through a cascading network of innovations, how to put new technology properly to work.

the Internet operating system would manage access to data subsystems providing services like confirming someone’s identity or determining their location

Robinson and company instead wanted the government to provide free access to bulk data so that anyone who wanted to could use it to build multiple competing services, possibly supported by a variety of business models

The question shouldn’t be whether or not government ought to be doing these things; it should be how to help government do a better job of fulfilling its responsibilities as a platform.

The first was that twenty-first-century apps could only take us so far if they were built on top of a broken twentieth-century government platform

The second realization was that understanding service delivery is the key to good policy making

Our third realization was brilliantly expressed in Jake’s account of the project, a Medium essay titled “People, Not Data”—that empathy, not just technology, is the key to successfully reinventing government services

Start with needs—user needs not government needs

Do less

Y]ou [can] no longer run a country properly if the elites don’t understand technology in the same way they grasp economics or ideology or propaganda. . . . What good governance and the good society look like is now inextricably linked to an understanding of the digital.”

We also learned that the practices that make good apps turn out to be very relevant for making good rules as well

The legitimate object of government is to do for the people what needs to be done, but which they cannot, by individual effort, do at all, or do so well, for themselves

These programs are workers, and the programmers who create them are their managers

Its insight, that “simple models and a lot of data trump more elaborate models based on less data,” has been fundamental to progress in field after field, and is at the heart of many Silicon Valley companies

fed to the model in order to train it. This can result in unintended bias. Possibly the most important questions in AI are not the design of new algorithms, but how to make sure that the data sets with which we train them are not inherently biased. Cathy O’Neil’s book Weapons of Math Destruction is essential reading on this topic

The unintended consequences of simply trying to apply old rules and classifications in the face of a radically different model highlight the need for deeper understanding of technology on the part of regulators, and for fresh thinking on the part of both regulators and the companies they seek to regulate

in many cases that process can be sped up enormously, and made fairer and clearer at the same time.

The more complex the regulations, the less likely they are to succeed, and the more fragile they are in the face of changing conditions.

As was done with credit card fraud, regulators should look to create incentives for companies themselves to practice the right behavior. For example, liability for misuse of data sold on to third parties would discourage sale of that data

Data aggregators, who collect data not in order to provide services directly to consumers, but to other businesses, should come in for particular scrutiny

As we saw with TCP/IP, the rules should ideally be intrinsic to the design of the platform, not something added to it. But as long as the rules, however complex, are aligned with the simple interests of the participants, as is the case with Google’s quest for relevance, regulation becomes largely invisible. Things just appear to work.

This brief history illuminates how easy it is to mix up means and ends

For this multi-factor optimization to work, though, Uber and Lyft have to make a deep commitment to evolving their algorithms to take into account all of the stakeholders in their marketplace. It is not clear that they are doing so

They should also define a process for modifying the regulation in response to what is learned through that measurement. And there must be a mechanism for resolving conflicts between overlapping regulations. If it is a complex regulation, this process should be followed for each subcomponent. The lessons about modularity from Jeff Bezos’s platform memo are surprisingly relevant to the design of regulations as well as to platforms and modern technology organizations

Relaxing licensing requirements and increasing the freedom to operate means more people can participate, and companies can experiment more freely. But “in exchange for that freedom to operate,” Nick continues, “companies will need to share data with regulators—un-massaged, and in real time, just like their users do with them. AND, will need to accept that that data may result in forms of accountability

But in today’s world, this has given way to a kind of continuous partial employment for most low-wage workers at large companies, where workplace scheduling software from vendors like ADP, Oracle, Kronos, Reflexis, and SAP lets retailers and fast-food companies build larger-than-needed on-demand labor pools to meet peak demand, and then parcel out the work in short shifts and in such a way that no one gets full-time hours. This design pattern has become the dominant strategy for managing low-wage workers in America

When you are drawing a map of new technologies, it’s essential to use the right starting point. Much analysis of the on-demand or “gig” economy has focused too narrowly on Silicon Valley without including the broader labor economy. Once you start drawing a map of “workers managed by algorithm” and “no guarantee of employment” you come up with a very different sense of the world

It is essential to look through the labels—employee and independent contractor—and examine the underlying reality that they point to. So often, we live in the world of labels and associated value judgments and assumptions, and forget to reduce our intellectual equation to the common denominators. As Alfred Korzybski so memorably wrote, we must remember that “the map is not the territory.”

Rather than cracking down on the new online gig economy businesses to make them more like twentieth-century businesses, regulators should be asking traditional low-wage employers to provide greater marketplace liquidity via data sharing

Air Force Colonel John Boyd, “the father of the F-16,” introduced the term OODA loop (“Observe-Orient-Decide-Act”) to describe why agility is more important in combat than pure firepower

The distance between human enthusiasm and the fundamentals can also be measured for news, using many signals that can be verified algorithmically by a computer, often more quickly and thoroughly than they can be verified by humans.

Algorithmic fact checking doesn’t replace human judgment. It amplifies our power to exercise it, in much the same way as earthmoving equipment amplifies our muscles. The signals it uses are similar to those that a human fact checker might use.

Few people trace the chain of sources to their origin, as I did. Many propaganda and fake news sites rely on that failure to spread falsity. Checking sources all the way back to their origin is something that computers are much better at doing than humans.

Citing and linking to sources makes it much easier to validate whether an assertion is an opinion or interpretation, and who is making it. This should be the gold standard for all reporting. If media reliably linked to sources, any story without sources would automatically become suspect.

that one of the most important roles for algorithms to play may be as a kind of circuit breaker, which pauses the spread of suspicious postings, providing “enough of a window to gather evidence and have it considered by humans who may choose to arrest the wave before it turns into a tsunami.” Bharat points out that it is not every false story that needs to be flagged, only those that are gaining momentum

So too, the essence of algorithm design is not to eliminate all error, but to make results robust in the face of error. The fundamental question to ask is not whether Facebook should be curating the newsfeed, but how

Where de Havilland tried in vain to engineer a plane where the materials were strong enough to resist all cracks and fatigue, Boeing realized that the right approach was to engineer a design that allowed cracks, but kept them from propagating so far that they led to catastrophic failure

When tuning algorithms, as in ordinary life, it is always better to tackle root causes than symptoms

Ray Dalio, the founder and executive chairman of Bridgewater Associates, uses a similar approach to creating what he calls an “idea meritocracy” at his company, the largest hedge fund in the world

The great question of the twenty-first century is going to be ‘Whose black box do you trust?

As Warren Buffett is reputed to have said, “It takes twenty years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently.”

Creating things that you don’t understand is really not a good idea no matter who owns it

According to political economist Mark Blyth, writing in Foreign Affairs, during the decades following World War II, government policy makers decided that “sustained mass unemployment was an existential threat to capitalism.” The guiding “fitness function” for Western economies thus became full employment

Any business owned by GE that wasn’t first or second in its market and wasn’t growing faster than the market as a whole would be sold or shuttered. Whether or not the unit provided useful jobs to a community or useful services to customers was not a reason to keep on with a line of business. Only the contribution to GE’s growth and profits, and hence its stock price, mattered.
That was our Skynet moment. The machine had begun its takeover.

The design of a system determines its outcomes. The robots did not force a human-hostile future upon us; we chose it ourselves.

But by elevating the single fitness function of increasing share price above all else, they hollowed out our overall economy.

of the previous century gave the economy a historically anomalous surge, or whether Fink and others are right that we simply aren’t making the investments we need, it is clear that companies are using stock buybacks to create the illusion of growth where real growth is lagging.

Stock prices are a map that should ideally describe the underlying prospects of companies; attempts to distort that map should be recognized for what they are. We need to add “fake growth” to “fake news” in our vocabulary to describe what is going on. Real growth improves people’s lives.

Mistaking what is good for financial markets for what is good for jobs, wages, and the lives of actual people is a fatal flaw in so many of the economic choices business leaders, policy makers, and politicians make

I’m a successful capitalist, but I’m tired of hearing that people like me create jobs. There’s only one thing that creates jobs, and that’s customers. And we’ve been screwing workers so long that they can no longer afford to be our customers.”
In making this point, Nick was echoing the arguments of Peter F. Drucker in his 1955 book, The Practice of Management: “There is only one valid definition of business purpose: to create a customer. . . . It is the customer who determines what a business is. It is the customer alone whose willingness to pay for a good or for a service converts economic resources into wealth, things into goods. . . . The customer is the foundation of a business and keeps it in existence.”

The single biggest unexplored reason for long-term slower growth,” she writes, “is that the financial system has stopped serving the real economy and now serves mainly itself

The system is rigged. Companies are forced to eliminate workers not by the market of real goods and services where supply and demand set the right price, but by the commands of financial markets, where hope and greed too often set the price.

Most people unthinkingly use the term the market to refer to these two very different markets. Recognizing that they are not the same is the first step toward solving the problem

Future economic historians may look back wryly at this period when we worshipped the divine right of capital while looking down on our ancestors who believed in the divine right of kings

The difference between theory and practice is always greater in practice than it is in theory.”

But Uber can do far better. Algorithms such as these can be a real advance in the structure of our economy, but only if they take into account the needs of workers as well as those of consumers, businesses, and investors

Whatever your position on what the right tilt ought to be, it should be clear that the low-wage jobs of today aren’t inevitable, any more than were the high-wage jobs of earlier decades.

Inequality feeds on itself, as the market becomes ever more optimized for those with more to spend.

The Overton Window, a term introduced by Joseph P. Overton of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, says that an idea’s political viability depends mainly on whether it falls within the window framing a range of policies considered politically acceptable in the current climate of public opinion

Fortunately, once the window has come unstuck, it is possible to move it radically new directions. This has generally happened in US history as a result of great dislocations, where business as usual just couldn’t continue. It took the Great Depression to give Franklin Roosevelt and Frances Perkins the license to put in place the New Deal. But given that license, they imagined the unimaginable.

It is only our acceptance of the notion that financial efficiency is the primary fitness function for the economy that locks us into the race to the bottom, in which humans are seen as a cost to be eliminated.

Why do productive and nonproductive investments get the same capital gains treatment

Here is one of the failed rules of today’s economy: Human labor should be eliminated as a cost whenever possible

We need to play the game of business as if people matter.

But technology is being used for cost reduction rather than to empower people and to reach for the stars not because that is what technology wants, but because it is what the legal and financial system we have built demands.

In his book Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy, he wrote: “I have come to read [the history of the innovation economy] as driven by three sets of continuous, reciprocal, interdependent games played between the state, the market economy, and financial capitalism.”

Having to find people who will pay you for what you create clears out an awful lot of wishful thinking.

Economist Carlota Perez makes the case that every technological revolution has been accompanied by a financial bubble, which funds investments in futures that have not yet come into being, investments that can be tolerated only because for every hundred failures there is a breakthrough so large that it pays off all the failed bets

Arguably, funding that kind of innovation is what capital markets are for, but it’s also possible that that capital can be used to destroy existing businesses without building something sustainable to take their place

For a company the size of Google, whose market capitalization at the end of that year was more than $500 billion, that $5.2 billion in stock compensation represented only a 1% dilution of existing shareholders. For a smaller company, like Salesforce, with a market capitalization closer to $50 billion, 1% would only be $500 million—so Salesforce can afford only a tenth as much to hire engineers even though it has a third as many employees as Google. As a result, one analyst said to me that Salesforce would eventually have to be sold to a bigger company

Even in the best case, when over time a company grows into its valuation and its shareholders earn their wealth in the real economy, there are damaging effects from having two currencies, one of them hiding in plain sight, that are valued so differently

I wanted O’Reilly Media to be like ESRI, founded by Jack and Laura Dangermond in 1969, or SAS Institute, founded by Jim Goodnight and John Sall in 1976, both private technology companies still going strong after decades of innovation

Is it possible for entrepreneurs to get the benefits of Silicon Valley investment without some of the downsides of the traditional venture capital model? Bryce

A major selling point for entrepreneurs in taking less cash up front from investors and shooting for a slower growth, cash-flow positive business is not to pay dividends, but to achieve greater independence, freedom, and control

If they are to break free from the mistakes of the failed philosophy of current financial markets, which too often hollow out the real economy and increase inequality, these platform companies must commit themselves to the health and sustainability of their partner ecosystems. This is not just a matter of idealism. It is a matter of self-interest

not all of those who borrow from the future recognize their obligation to pay back their moral debt by making that a better future. Supermoney is not a gift. It is an obligation.

Company financial statements routinely measure and report on the value captured by the company for its owners. Little is routinely done to measure the value that is created for others. That needs to change.

It would be great to see standardized financial measures of the ratio between the value created for the owners and investors in a company and the value created for other stakeholders

we often ignore and take for granted many types of economic value when, in 1975, I read an essay by environmentalist Steve Baer published in Stewart Brand’s Co-Evolution Quarterly, the successor to The Whole Earth Catalog. The essay was called “The Clothesline Paradox

Prosperity in human societies is best understood as the accumulation of solutions to human problems. We won’t run out of work until we run out of problems.”

the citizen’s dividend,” the name given to it in Thomas Paine’s Agrarian Justice. Paine made the appeal for sharing the value of unimproved land with every citizen of the new United States; Buchheit suggests that all of mankind should have some claim on the fruits of technological progress

His notion of human money encompasses two very different classes of goods and services: those that involve a human-to-human touch—parenting, teaching, caregiving of all kinds—and those that involve creativity.

If you want to understand the future, just look at what rich people do today

In the United States, more than 4,200 craft breweries now make up more than 10% of the market, and command a price double that of a mass-produced beer

As crowdfunding sites like Patreon (and, of course, Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and GoFundMe) show, there are increasingly new opportunities for ordinary people to compete for real currency, not just attention

moderate, regular physical activity. But even more important were a sense of purpose, engagement in spirituality or religion, and engagement in family and social life.

The Apple Store has nothing to do with on-demand, the map that most people use to understand these new platforms, yet it has a great deal in common with them as a lesson plan for constructing a magical user experience made possible by networked, cognitively augmented workers connected to a data-rich platform that recognizes its customers and tailors its services to them.

I remember once reading an account of the crossing of the land bridge between Siberia and Alaska that used a curious fact as part of its analysis of the possible date. It couldn’t have happened before the invention of sewing, the authors noted, which made possible the piecing together of close-fitting garments that allowed humans to live in cold climes

It was language that was our greatest invention, the ability to pass fire from mind to mind. In periods where knowledge is embraced and widely shared, society advances and becomes richer. When knowledge is hoarded or disregarded, society becomes poorer

The three-part process of creating new knowledge, sharing it, and then embedding it into tools so that it can be used by less skilled workers is illustrated neatly by the rise of big data technologies.

employees David Friedberg and Siraj Khaliq, and paired it with Precision Planting, the data-driven control system for seed placement and depth based on soil composition, they showcased that the new focus of productivity in agriculture is in data and control.

D printing doesn’t just provide low-cost prototyping and local manufacturing. It makes possible different kinds of geometries than traditional manufacturing. That requires software that encourages human designers to explore possibilities far afield from the familiar

By the time the first classes teaching BASIC appeared in schools, the industry had moved far beyond it. By the time schools were teaching how to build websites with PHP, the bigger opportunity was in building smartphone apps or in mastering statistics and big data

That lag was key to O’Reilly’s success over the past few decades as the publisher of record on emerging technologies. No one was teaching what people needed to know. We had to learn it from each other

People need a base—knowing enough to ask the right questions and to take in new knowledge.
People learn from each other.
People learn best by doing, solving real problems and pulling in the knowledge they need on demand.
People learn best when what they are doing is so compelling that they want to do it on their own time, not just because the job asks them to do it.

This design pattern, that the future is built before it can be bought, is an important one to recognize. The future is created by people who can make and invent things and those who can tinker and improve and put inventions into practice. These are people who learn by doing

The early web was very simple. Clever new “hacks” were introduced all the time, and we gleefully copied them from each other with abandon. Someone came up with a clever solution; it quickly became the common property of everyone else who had the same problem

Stuart Firestein, in his book Ignorance, makes the case that science is not the collection of what we know. It is the practice of investigating what we don’t know. Ignorance, not knowledge, drives science

So Feynman resolved to go back to having fun, and stop being so goal-driven in his research

Once you have curiosity, the Internet has provided powerful new ways to feed it. In their book, The Power of Pull, John Hagel III, John Seely Brown, and Lang Davison outline a fundamental change in the nature of twenty-first century learning

This combination of learning by doing, social sharing, and on-demand expertise is central to how people—especially young people—learn today

Someone with structural literacy knows what to look for. They have a functional map of how things ought to work. Those lacking that map are helpless.

One of the problems with many online learning platforms for teaching new technology is that structural literacy is all they provide

In the end, on-demand education is not that dissimilar from on-demand transportation. You need a rich marketplace of people who know things, and others who need to know them. The way that knowledge is delivered—book, video, face-to-face teaching—gets a lot of attention, but the bigger question is how to bootstrap a rich knowledge network.

That was certainly true of me. I studied Greek and Latin in college. Everything I learned about computers, I learned on the job. The knowledge I learned in college was useless to me. The habits of mind that I formed were what mattered, the foundational skills of study, and particularly the ability to recognize patterns. The struggle to parse complex Greek texts that were, quite frankly, beyond my skill in the language was great preparation when I took on the challenge of documenting programs written in programming languages that at first I barely understood. It is not just knowledge that we have to teach, it is the ability to learn. To learn constantly. Over the course of my career, learning itself has been the most important part of my ongoing work.

Clive Thompson asks a provocative question: Is coding becoming a blue-collar job? “These sorts of coders won’t have the deep knowledge to craft wild new algorithms for flash trading or neural networks,” he writes. “But any blue-collar coder will be plenty qualified to sling JavaScript for their local bank

The point of a disruptive technology is not the market or the competitors that it destroys. It is the new markets and the new possibilities that it creates. Just like transistor radios or the early World Wide Web, these new markets are often too small for established companies to consider them worth pursuing. By the time they wake up, an upstart has taken a leadership position in the emerging segment

I spend a lot of time urging Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to forget about disruption, and instead to work on stuff that matters

1. WORK ON SOMETHING THAT MATTERS TO YOU MORE THAN MONEY

Money is like gas in the car—you need to pay attention or you’ll end up on the side of the road—but a successful business or a well-lived life is not a tour of gas stations.

Pursue something so important that even if you fail, the world is better off for you having tried.

In similar fashion, we need to set a goal for AI that is sufficiently bold and ambitious, one that goes beyond anything that can be achieved through incremental improvements to current technology.”

2. CREATE MORE VALUE THAN YOU CAPTURE

If my goal is really “changing the world by spreading the knowledge of innovators,” I’m thrilled when my competitors jump on the bandwagon and help me spread the word.

Focusing on solving big problems rather than on making money, and focusing on creating more value than you capture, are closely related principles. The first one is a test that applies to those starting something new; the second is the harder test that you must pass in order to create something enduring.
