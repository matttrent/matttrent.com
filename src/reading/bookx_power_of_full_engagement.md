# bookx power of full engagement

## Objective 

To build the necessary capacity to sustain high performance in the face of increasing demand. 

## Full Engagement Principles 

1. Managing energy, not time, is the key to high performance. 
2. Full engagement requires drawing on four separate but related dimensions of energy: 
    - Physical 
    - Emotional 
    - Mental 
    - Spiritual 
3. Because energy capacity diminishes with both overuse and underuse, we must learn to balance energy 
    expenditure with intermittent energy renewal. 
4. To build capacity, we must push beyond our normal limits, training in the same systematic way that elite athletes do. 
5. Positive energy rituals–highly specific routines for managing energy–are the key to full engagement and sustained high performance. 

## Barriers to Full Engagement 

Negative habits that block, distort, waste, diminish, deplete, and contaminate stored energy. 

## The Full-Engagement Training System 

Remove barriers by establishing strategic positive energy rituals that ensure sufficient capacity in all dimensions. 

## Sustained High Performance 

1.  Most of us are under trained physically and spiritually (not enough stress) and over trained mentally and emotionally (not enough recovery). 
2.  Sustained high performance is best served by assuming the mentality of a sprinter, not a marathoner. 
3.  Over the span of a 30 to 40 year career, performance is optimized by scheduling work into 90- to 120-minute periods of intensive effort followed by shorter periods of recovery and renewal. 

## Most Important Physical Energy Management Strategies

Physical energy is the fundamental source of fuel in life.  If you don’t have enough physical energy, you won’t have adequate emotional and mental energy.  That’s why it’s imperative to eat right, get enough rest, and exercise regularly.  Making that commitment will give your body and mind the best kind of energy.   

1.  Go to bed early and wake up early. 
2.  Go to sleep and wake up consistently at the same times. 
3.  Eat 5 to 6 small meals daily. 
4.  Eat breakfast every day. 
5.  Eat a balanced, healthy diet. 
6.  Minimize simple sugars. 
7.  Drink 48 to 64 ounces of water daily. 
8.  Take breaks every 90 minutes during work. 
9.  Get some physical activity daily. 
10.  Do at least two cardiovascular interval workouts and two strength training workouts a week.

## Eight Steps to Balancing Your Energy 

1.  __Change Your Eating Habits.__   
    Food is your only source of energy, so consciously eating to maintain energy will have an impact.  The  two most important things you can do are: 
    1.  Eat breakfast to get your metabolism rolling every morning.
    2.  Stabilize your blood sugar by eating a snack at least every two hours. 
2.  __Balance Your Recovery Time.__   
    With any major energy expenditure in your day, create a wave of recovery to balance the scales, which means taking time to relax, breathe deeply, and settle down. 
3.  __Create Rituals.__  
    Most people have very little will and discipline.  Building rituals into your time will help you keep your commitments.  Your rituals should be as rigid as possible so that they become automatic over time.   
4.  __Be Positive.__   
    Whatever you’re doing that you consider a struggle, invent ways to look at it  more positively.  Shift from negative to positive thinking to start really enjoying your life. 
5.  __Stop Multitasking.__   
    When you’re doing more than one thing at one time, you’re not giving all of your energy to anything. Focus on the most important thing at that moment to save energy in the long run. 
6.  __Know What Matters to You and Focus on What Matters to You.__  
    The only way to make your life extraordinary is to know what extraordinary means to you.  On your  dying day, what criteria could you use to measure the success of your life? Once you know what matters, set your priorities accordingly.  Use rituals to help you make sure to spend enough time every day on the things you care about. 
7.  __Beat “Energy Vampires.”__   
    “Energy vampires” are negative drains on your life.  Beating them is often a matter of making good choices.  Ask yourself how important the things draining your energy really are.  Eliminate the ones that aren’t included in your core list of values or desires. 
8.  __Use Your Stress.__   
    Instead of  trying to eliminate your stress or stormy periods in your life, use them and recognize that these periods are your best times for growth.

## personal mba book notes

### 1: Time is not the most important thing to manage – energy is what’s actually important.

Most productivity thinkers over the years have fixated on the idea of time: there are only so many hours in a day, so if you want to be an effective person, you should learn to manage them wisely.

Time, however, passes on its own – you can’t really manage it. What you can manage is the energy you bring to those hours.

If you’re low on energy, it doesn’t matter if you have a lot of time to accomplish a task – you’ll be so exhausted that you’ll make very little progress. If you have a ton of energy, you can get many things done in very little time.

The Power of Full Engagement is about managing your energy, and helping you find ways to feel more energetic each day.

### 2: Wise use of available energy is what leads to results.

Energy is finite, but expandable. You only have so much energy to use each day, but our capacity for productive effort expands as we use it. As long as you take care of yourself and pay attention to how much energy you have, you can accomplish surprising amounts of work.

### 3: All hours aren’t created equal – pay attention to your energy cycles, which naturally oscillate.

Time management proponents make the mistake of assuming all hours are fungible – equal to any other. On a calendar, there’s no visible difference between 9:00-10:00am and 12:00-1:00pm.

Physically, there’s a huge difference. Our body operates in Energy Cycles in which our energy fluctuates up and down. You may be familiar with the circadian cycle, which is responsible for our waking/sleeping pattern. There are other cycles as well, which naturally oscillates every 90 minutes between high and low energy.

This cycle is normal, so it pays to respect it. Every hour and a half or so, your body needs a bit of relaxation and rest. Powering through the dip in energy is actually counterproductive – you’re not giving your body the rest it needs to operate at peak performance.

### 4: Energy diminishes with overuse and underuse – it’s best to think in terms of sprinting and recovery.

When working, think like a sprinter – you can cover a lot of ground in a quick burst, but you can’t keep up that pace all day. With a little rest between bursts, however, you can sprint over and over again.

If you tax yourself too much, you’ll wear yourself out, and you’ll need a longer period of recovery before you’ll be ready to go again. At the extreme, some people work themselves to the point of exhaustion, at which point their body forces them to recover via injury or illness. You can only push yourself so much – Recovery is mandatory, not optional.

### 5: You are not a machine: humans need relaxation, rest, and recovery for top performance.

The ideal many people seem to have about human productivity is working like a robot: no rest, no food, no sleep, no recovery all day every day. That’s a recipe for disaster.

Humans are physical beings, and we have physical needs. Instead of viewing your body as a vehicle for your brain, it’s useful to think of your body as one integrated tool, which you use to get things done. If the tool breaks or wears down, you won’t accomplish anything.

Here’s a great little story Warren Buffett often tells: if you were told that you could only have one car for the rest of your life, you would take immaculate care of it. You would polish, protect, and maintain it as best as you could. Our body serves the same purpose, so treat it the same way.

### 6: You have a Gas Tank – if you don’t take care of yourself, you’ll inevitably break down.

I’m willing to bet that at some point in your life, you reached your breaking point – I certainly have. You don’t have unlimited energy, and if you don’t take care of yourself, you’ll collapse. That’s never a good thing. You have a Gas Tank, just like any vehicle, and when you run out, you’re sunk.

I recommend pushing to the point of 80-90% of your capacity, then going no further. That approach helps you stretch your limits and get a lot accomplished while still leaving ample time for relaxation and rest.

### 7: Used consciously, stress is a good thing – it’s a form of energy resistance training.

On the other end of the spectrum, it’s possible to exert yourself too little. Stress is not always negative – it’s a signal our bodies use to generate more energy to meet the demand. As long as we’re getting enough rest and recovery, it pays to exert ourselves – that’s how we become stronger over time.

### 8: Daily rituals can help you keep your energy high.

Taking care of yourself is a huge priority, and there are a few simple habits that can help keep your energy levels high each day.

Food is your body’s fuel – ensure you’re getting enough (not too much), that’s it’s high quality, and that it contains enough of the protein and nutrients your body needs to function optimally. You also need enough water: tea is also a good option for variety. Stay away from refined sugars. When in doubt, eat like humans ate thousands of years ago. (Personally, I also have to be careful about wheat gluten, which I discovered via self-experimentation.)

Vitamins are also important – our diet has changed dramatically in the past several thousand years, and so we often don’t get many of the trace minerals we need to function optimally. (Side note: I recommend reading The Protein Power Lifeplan by Dan and Mary Eades for a detailed examination of what our body needs to function optimally.)

### 9: It pays to track your energy cycles, so you can plan to maximize them.

Everyone’s energy cycles are a little different, so it pays to learn what yours are. I recommend using a variant of what Peter Drucker recommends in The Effective Executive: keep a time journal, but focus on your energy levels throughout the day. Every hour or so, tune in to how you’re feeling – are you at a high point, or at a low point.

Once you know your patterns, it’s far easier to plan your day around your cycles. For example, my best times for focused attention are mid-morning and early afternoon. Accordingly, I schedule my day to allow me to write during those periods, and as a result, I get more done.

### 10: Time should be spent either being productive or consciously resting – otherwise, it’s time wasted.

Have you ever had a day where you half-worked? At the end of the day, you didn’t get much done, but you felt like you had just run a marathon?

Those days are days wasted. If you’re not being productive, take a break – a real break. Pretending to work does no one any good. Recharge your batteries, then go back to your work when you’re relaxed and refreshed.

This principle is a strong case for taking an afternoon nap – after lunch, your body goes into a natural down cycle. Taking advantage of that natural down period to recharge isn’t lazy – it’s very smart. By taking twenty minutes to relax and recharge, you’re setting yourself up for a more productive afternoon.

## chapters

### Fully Engaged, Energy, Not Time, Is Our Most Precious Resources.

- Every one of our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors has an energy consequence, for better or for worse. The ultimate measure of our lives is not how much time we spend on the planet, butrather how much energy we invest in the time that we have.
- Managing energy, not time, is the fundamental currency of high performance.
- Performance isgrounded in the skillful management of energy.
- Great leaders are stewards of organizational energy. They begin by effectively managing theirown energy. As leaders, they must mobilize, focus, invest, channel, renew and expand theenergy of others.
- Full engagement is the energy state that best serves performance.
- _Principle 1:_ Full engagement requires drawing on four separate but related sources of energy: PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, MENTAL and SPIRITUAL.
- _Principle 2:_ Because energy diminishes both with overuse and with underuse, we must balanceenergy expenditure with intermittent energy renewal.
- _Principle 3:_ To build capacity we must push beyond our normal limits, training in the samesystematic way that elite athletes do.
- Principle 4: Positive energy rituals -- high specific routines for managing energy -- are the key tofully engagement and sustained high performance.
- Making change that lasts requires a three-step process:
- Define purpose, Face the Truth,and Take Action

### The Pulse of High Performance: Balancing Stress and Recovery

- Energy is simply the capacity to do work. Our most fundamental need as human beings is tospend and recover energy. We call this oscillation.
- The opposite of oscillation is linearity: too much energy expenditure without recovery or toomuch recovery without sufficient energy expenditure.
- Balancing stress and recovery is critical to high performance both individually andorganizationally.
- We must sustain healthy oscillatory rhythms at all four levels of what we term the “Performance pyramid”: Physical, emotional, mental and spiritual.
- We build emotional, mental and spiritual capacity in precisely the same 
- way that we buildphysical capacity. We must systematically expose ourselves to stress beyond our normal limits,followed by adequate recovery.
- Expanding capacity requires a willingness to endure short-term discomfort 
  in the service of long-term reward.

### Physical Energy: Fueling the Fire

- Physical energy is the fundamental source of fuel in life.
- Physical energy is derived from the interaction between oxygen and glucose.
- The two most important regulators of physical energy are Breathing and Eating.
- Eating five to six low-calorie, highly nutritious meals a day ensures a steady resupply of glucoseand essential nutrients.
- Drinking sixty-four ounces (about 2 liters) of water daily is a key factor in the effectivemanagement of physical energy.
- Most human beings require seven to eight hours of sleep per night to function optimally.
- Going to bed early and waking up early help to optimize performance.
- Interval training is more effective than steady-state exercise in building physical capacity and inteaching people how to recover more efficiently.
- To sustain full engagement, we must take a recovery break every 90 to 120 minutes.

### Emotional Energy: Transforming Threat into Challenge

- In order to perform at our best, we must access pleasant and positive emotions: theexperience of enjoyment, challenge, adventure and opportunity.
- The key muscles fueling positive emotional energy are self-confidence, self-control,interpersonal effectiveness and empathy.
- Negative emotions serve survival but they are very costly and energy inefficient in the contextof performance.
- The ability to summon positive emotions during periods of intense stress lies a the heart of effective leadership.
- Access to the emotional muscles that serve performance depends on creating a balancebetween exercising them regularly and intermittently seeking recovery.
- Any activity that is enjoyable, fulfilling and affirming serves as a source of emotional renewealand recovery.
- Emotional muscles such as patience, empathy and confidence can be strengthened in the sameway that we strengthen a bicep or tricep: pushing past our current limits followed by recovery.

### Mental Energy: Appropriate Focus and Realistic Optimism

- Mental capacity is what we use to organize our lives and focus our attention.
- The mental energy that best serves full engagement is realistic optimism –
- seeing the world asit is, but always working positively towards a desired outcome or solution.
- The key supportive mental muscles include mental preparation, visualization, positive self-talk,effective time management and creativity.
- Changing channels mentally permits different parts of the brain to be activated and facilitatescreativity.
- Physical exercise stimulates cognitive capacity.
- Maximum mental capacity is derived from a balance expending and recovering mental energy.
- When we lack the mental muscles we need to perform at our best, we must systematically buildcapacity by pushing past our comfort zone and then recovering.
- Continuing to challenge the brain serve as a protection against age-related mental decline.

### Spiritual Energy: He Who Has a Why to Live

- Spiritual energy provides the force for action in all dimensions of our lives. It fuels passion,perseverance and commitment.
- Spiritual energy is derived from a connection to deeply held values and a purpose beyond ourself-interest.
- Character – the courage and conviction to live by our deepest values – is the key muscle thatserves spiritual energy.
- The key supportive spiritual muscles are passion, commitment, integrity and honesty.
- Spiritual energy expenditure and energy renewal are deeply interconnected.
- Spiritual energy is sustained by balancing a commitment to a purpose beyond ourselves withadequate self-care.
- Spiritual work can be demanding and renewing at the same time.
- Expending spiritual capacity involves pushing past our comfort zone in precisely the same waythat expanding physical capacity does.
- The energy of the human spirit can override even severe limitations of physical energy.

### Defining Purpose: The Rules of Engagement

- The search for meaning is among the most powerful and enduring themes in every culturesince the origin of recorded history.
- The “hero’s journey” is grounded in mobilizing, nurturing and regularly renewing our most precious resource – energy – in the service of what matters most.
- When we lack a strong sense of purpose we are easily buffeted by life’s inevitable storms.
- Purpose becomes a more powerful and enduring source of energy when its source moves fromnegative to positive, external to internal and self to others.
- A negative source of purpose is defensive and deficit-based.
- Intrinsic motivation grows out of the desire to engage in an activity because we value it for theinherent satisfaction it provides.
- Values fuel the energy on which purpose is built. They hold us to a different standard formanaging our energy.
- A virtue is a value in action.
- A vision statement, grounded in values that are meaningful and compelling, creates a blueprintfor how to invest our energy.


### Face the Truth: How Are You Managing Your Energy Now?

- Avoiding the truth consumes great effort energy. Facing the truth frees up energy and is thesecond stage, after defining purpose, in becoming more fully engaged.
- At the most basic level, we deceive ourselves in order to protect our self-esteem.
- Some truths are too unbearable to be absorbed all at once. Emotions such as grief are bestmetabolized in waves.
- Truth without compassion is cruelty – to others and to ourselves.
- What we fail to acknowledge about ourselves we often continue to act out unconsciously.
- A common form of self-deception is assuming that our view represents the truth, when it isreally just a lens through which we choose to view the world.
- Facing the truth requires that we retain an ongoing openness to the possibility that we may notbe seeing ourselves – or others – accurately.
- It is both a danger and delusion when we become too identified with any singular view of ourselves. We are all a blend of light and shadow, virtues and vices.
- Accepting our limitations reduces our defensiveness and increases the amount of positiveenergy available to us.


### Taking Action: The Power of Positive Rituals

- Rituals serve as tools through which we effectively manage energy in the service of whatevermission we are on.
- Rituals create a means by which to translate our values and priorities into action in alldimensions of our life.
- All great performers rely on positive rituals to manage their energy and regulate their behavior.
- The limitations of conscious will and discipline are rooted in the fact that every demand on ourself-control draws on the same limited resource.
- We can offset our limited will and discipline by building rituals that become automatic asquickly as possible, fueled by our deepest values.
- The most important role of rituals is to insure effective balance between energy expenditureand energy renewal in the service of full engagement.
- The more exacting the challenge and the greater the pressure, the more rigorous our ritualsneed to be.
- Precision and specificity are critical dimensions of building rituals during the thirty-to sixty-dayacquisition period.
- Trying not to do something rapidly depletes our limited stores of will and discipline.
- To make lasting change, we must build serial rituals, focusing on one significant change at a time.
