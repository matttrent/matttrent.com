Skill is a cellular insulation that wraps neural circuits and that grows in response to certain signals.

they are purposely operating at the edges of their ability, so they will screw up. 

Deep practice is built on a paradox: struggling in certain targeted ways—operating at the edges of your ability, where you make mistakes—makes you smarter. Or to put it a slightly different way, experiences where you're forced to slow down, make errors, and correct them—as you would if you were walking up an ice-covered hill, slipping and stumbling as you go—end up making you swift and graceful without your realizing it.

“We tend to think of our memory as a tape recorder, but that's wrong,” he said. “It's a living structure, a scaffold of nearly infinite size. The more we generate impulses, encountering and overcoming difficulties, the more scaffolding we build. The more scaffolding we build, the faster we learn.”

Futsal compresses soccer's essential skills into a small box; 

Struggle is not an option: it's a biological requirement.

The more we develop a skill circuit, the less we're aware that we're using it.

They became great writers not in spite of the fact that they started out immature and imitative but because they were willing to spend vast amounts of time and energy being immature and imitative

Geniuses are not scattered uniformly through time and space, he pointed out; to the contrary, they tend to appear in clusters.

Apprentices learned the craft from the bottom up, not through lecture or theory but through action: mixing paint, preparing canvases, sharpening chisels.  _NOTE: Like my data science education, minus the mentorship._

When chunking has been done effectively, it creates a mirage that gives rise to the HSE.

RULE ONE: CHUNK IT UP

Deep practice feels a bit like exploring a dark and unfamiliar room. You start slowly, you bump into furniture, stop, think, and start again.

First, the participants look at the task as a whole—as one big chunk, the megacircuit. Second, they divide it into its smallest possible chunks. Third, they play with time, slowing the action down, then speeding it up, to learn its inner architecture. 

ABSORB THE WHOLE THING.

absorbing a picture of the skill until you can imagine yourself doing it.

“I would sing and sing, and hurt and hurt, because I knew I wasn't doing it right,”

BREAK IT INTO CHUNKS.

Students scissor each measure of their sheet music into horizontal strips, which are stuffed into envelopes and pulled out in random order.

SLOW IT DOWN.

At Meadowmount jagged bursts of notes are stretched into whale sounds.

As football coach Tom Martinez likes to say, “It's not how fast you can do it. It's how slow you can do it correctly.”

“This showed that experts practice differently and far more strategically. When they fail, they don't blame it on luck or themselves. They have a strategy they can fix.”

RULE TWO: REPEAT IT

Myelin, as Bartzokis reminds us, is living tissue. Like everything else in the body, it's in a constant cycle of breakdown and repair. That's why daily practice matters, particularly as we get older.

“If I skip practice for one day, I notice. If I skip practice for two days, my wife notices. If I skip for three days, the world notices.”

Spending more time is effective—but only if you're still in the sweet spot at the edge of your capabilities, attentively building and honing circuits.

most world-class experts—including pianists, chess players, novelists, and athletes—practice between three and five hours a day, no matter what skill they pursue.

People at most of the hotbeds I visited practiced less than three hours a day.

RULE THREE: LEARN TO FEEL IT

But you don't learn by gliding.”

Deep practice tends to leave people exhausted: they can't maintain it for more than an hour or two at a sitting 

had received a clear signal—-you can do this too—and the four-minute mark, once an insurmountable wall, was instantly recast as a stepping-stone.
This is how ignition works. Where deep practice is a cool, conscious act, ignition is a hot, mysterious burst, an awakening.

a vision of their ideal future selves, a vision that oriented, energized, and accelerated progress, and that originated in the outside world. 

“If we're in a nice, easy, pleasant environment, we naturally shut off effort,” Bargh said. “Why work? But if people get the signal that it's rough, they get motivated now.

Accordingly, ignition is determined by simple if/then propositions, with the then part always the same—better get busy.

you are not safe

 the same universal principles that govern all of us: (1) talent requires deep practice; (2) deep practice requires vast amounts of energy; (3) primal cues trigger huge outpourings of energy.

What skill-building really is, is confidence-building.

Half of the kids were praised for their intelligence (“You must be smart at this”), and half were praised for their effort (“You must have worked really hard”).

When we praise children for their intelligence,” Dweck wrote, “we tell them that's the name of the game: look smart, don't risk making mistakes.”

But the group praised for its intelligence hated the harder test. They took it as proof they weren't smart.”

“We are exquisitely attuned to messages telling us what is valued,”

 language that affirmed the value of effort and slow progress rather than innate talent or intelligence.

motivation does not increase with increased levels of praise but often dips

reaching down, speaking to the ground-level effort, affirming the struggle.

self-discipline was twice as accurate as IQ in predicting the students' grade-point average.

how swiftly and completely they take on the KIPP identity that provides the fuel for that hard work.

They listened far more than they talked. They seemed allergic to giving pep talks or inspiring speeches; they spent most of their time offering small, targeted, highly specific adjustments.

But 75 percent were pure information: what to do, how to do it, when to intensify an activity. One of Wooden's most frequent forms of teaching was a three-part instruction where he modeled the right way to do something, showed the incorrect way, and then remodeled the right way

Wooden famously began each year by showing players how to put on their socks, to minimize the chance of blisters.

explanation, demonstration, imitation, correction, and repetition. “Don't look for the big, quick improvement. Seek the small improvement one day at a time.

many world-class talents, particularly in piano, swimming, and tennis, start out with seemingly average teachers.

they are tapping into the second element of the talent code: ignition. They are creating and sustaining motivation; they are teaching love.

“Great teachers focus on what the student is saying or doing,” he says, “and are able, by being so focused and by their deep knowledge of the subject matter, to see and recognize the inarticulate stumbling, fumbling effort of the student who's reaching toward mastery, and then connect to them with a targeted message.”

Matrix is Gallimore's word for the vast grid of task-specific knowledge that distinguishes the best teachers and allows them to creatively and effectively respond to a student's efforts.

they had once been promising talents in their respective fields but failed and tried to figure out why.

Several master coaches told me that they trained their eyes to be like cameras, and they share that same Panavision quality.

approached new students with the curiosity of an investigative reporter. They sought out details of their personal lives, finding out about family, income, relationships, motivation.

Most master coaches delivered their information to their students in a series of short, vivid, high-definition bursts.

As soon as the student could accomplish the feat (play that chord, hit that volley), the coach would quickly layer in an added difficulty.

Playing violin, golf, gymnastics, and figure skating, on the other hand, are consistent-circuit skills, depending utterly on a solid foundation of technique that enables us to reliably re-create the fundamentals of an ideal performance. (This is why self-taught violinists, skaters, and gymnasts rarely reach world-class level and why self-taught novelists, comedians, and soccer players do all the time.)

I feel it in a changed attitude toward failure, which doesn't feel like a setback or the writing on the wall anymore, but like a path forward.
