### Preamble: The Lion Caged

In London he will give those who disagree with him a fair hearing; two of his favorite aphorisms are “I would rather be right than consistent” and “In the course of my life I have often had to eat my words, and I must confess that I have always found it a wholesome diet.”

### Part One: Shoals

His lightning prewar strokes startled a sane world unable to grasp the stark fact that he was not sane

### Part Two: Reef

William James once wrote that men of genius differ from ordinary men not in any innate quality of the brain, but in the aims and purposes on which they concentrate and in the degree of concentration which they manage to achieve. Napoleon, himself great, called it the mental power “de fixer les objets longtemps sans être fatigué”—to concentrate on objectives for long periods without tiring

The unforgivable sin of a commander, said Napoleon, is to “form a picture”—to assume that the enemy will act a certain way in a given situation, when in fact his response may be altogether different

### Part Three: Undertow

But the appeasers, like all fundamentalists, held facts in contempt

the same peculiar mélange of exceptional energy and an unreliable constitution

But it was part of the Churchill syndrome that despite diversions he had absolute concentration during the hours set aside for work, and that other activities were actually necessary to fuel this power. One activity was social intercourse; he needed people as ships need water

Working with his hands was equally important. Every day he laid bricks, building a wall which, he promised Clemmie, would be completed when she arrived home

Among the unhappier facts of life is that desire peaks in the two sexes at disparate ages. “The elementary notion of standardization,” Mencken noted, “seems never to have occurred to the celestial Edison.” A male is lustiest at fifteen; the average female reaches the heights of passion in her mid-thirties

On the whole, public men are wise to avoid extravagant predictions

### Part Four: Vortex

Late that night, after a BBC broadcast announced that Hitler had annexed Bohemia, Churchill—who was at the time writing about the late seventeenth century—told his son: “It’s hard to take one’s attention off the events of today and concentrate on the reign of James II—but I’m going to do it.” It was perhaps the most remarkable example of his genius for concentration

### Part Five: Surge

The War Office is always preparing for the last war.” Now, he thought, it was “certainly true of the French

Lack of decision is the worst fault from which a policy can suffer. So soon as a decision has been taken no time should be lost in announcing it…. It is of the first importance that we should know our own minds; it is of almost equal importance that the world should make no mistake about our intentions

### Part Six: Cataclysm

But neither England nor France was interested in military innovation between the wars. Victors rarely are. Professional soldiers are wedded to tradition and resent change; politicians and the public flinch at the prospect of slaughter
