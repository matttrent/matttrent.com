# Tribe

Humans don't mind hardship, in fact they thrive on it; what they mind is not feeling necessary.  Modern society has perfected the art of making people not feel necessary.

I lived in a time and place where nothing dangerous every really happened.

## the men and the dogs

Humans evolved in smaller tighter-knit societies.  Despite all our societal progress, our brains have not caught up.  Modern society has reduced the role of community and increased the role of authority and property.  While people have more physical possessions, there is a greater disparity with others, and individuals spend much more time in isolation.

In colonial America, emigration always seemed to go from civilized to tribal.  The reluctance of Bouquet's captives to leave the adopted tribe raised awkward questions about the supposed superiority of Western society.

Indian religion was less harsh, and Indian society was essentially classless and egalitarian.  Because of these basic freedoms, tribal members tended to be exceedingly loyal.

__But why is Western society so unappealing?__

As societies become more affluent they tend to require more, rather than less, time and commitment by the individual, and it's possible that many people feel that afflunce and safety simply aren't a good trade for freedom.

The relatively relaxed pace of !Kung life--even during times of adversity--challenged long-standing ideals that modern society created a surplus of leisure time.  __The !Kung had far fewer belongings than Westerners, but their lives were under much greater personal control.__  

They would have done almost everything in the company of others.  They would have almost never been alone.  Agriculture and industry change two fundamental things about the human experience:

- the accumulation of personal property
- people found themselves able to live independently from any communal group

Rather than buffering people from clinical depression, increased wealth in society seems to foster it.  Poor people are forced to share their time and resources more than wealthy people are, and as a result they live in closer communities.  Financial independence can lead to isolation.  Modern society seems to emphasize extrinsic values over intrinsic ones.

**Self-determination theory: human beings need 3 things in order to be content: they need to feel competent at what they do; they need to feel authentic in their lives; and they need to feel connected to others.**

"The economic and marketing forces of modern society have engineered an environment…that maximize[s] consumption at the long-term cost of well-being."

Infants in hunter-gatherer societies are carried by their mothers as much as 90% of the time.

As modern society has reduced the role of community, it simultaneously elevated the role of authority.  

One of [hunter gatherer societies] most common traits was the absence of major wealth disparities between individuals.  Another was the absence of arbitrary authority.  

One of the most commonly punished infractions was "failure to share".  Freeloading on the hard work of others and bullying were also high up on the list.  Subsistence-level hunters are necessarily more moral than other people; they just can't get away with selfish behavior because they live in small groups where almost everything is open to scrutiny.

The fact that a group of people can cost American society several trillion dollars in losses—roughly one-quarter that year's gross domestic product—and not be tried for high crimes shows how completely de-tribalize the country has become.  A tribe like the !Kung would not permit that because it would represent a serious threat to group cohesion and survival.

The American Indian should serve as the model for how to eridacate poverty and bring natural rights back to civilized life.

## war makes you an animal

Disaster unites people.  It erases class boundaries.  Modern society has gravely disrupted the social bonds that have always characterized human experience and disasters thrust people back into a more ancient, organic way of relating.  These bonds are strong enough that the sense of belonging can temporarily erase mental health issues.

Humans are so strongly wired to help one another---and enjoy such enormous social benefits from doing so---that people regularly risk their lives for complete strangers.  While men and women exhibit these risk behaviors differently, the both do.

Survivors of the siege of Sarajevo long for who they were during the war.

In many tribal societies, young men had to prove themselves by undergoing initiation rights that demonstrated their readiness for manhood.  Suddenly the draft care wasn't so much an obligation as a chance to be part of something bigger than myself.  These [young men's] deaths can be thought of as one generation after another trying to run their own initiation rights because they live in a society that no longer does that for them.  

**A longing for the kind of maturity and respect that often comes with [completing an intiation rite].**

**If I were to design my own initiation right, what would it be?**

One thing that can be said for societal collapse is that—for a while at least—everyone is equal.  Communities that have been devastated by a natural or man-made disasters almost never lapse into chaos and disorder; if anything, they become more just, more egalitarian, and more deliverately fair to individuals.  If anything, [...] social bonds were reinforced during disasters.

"An earthquake achieves what the law promises but does not in practice maintain.  The equality of all men."

Conduct was so good in shelters that volunteers never even had to summon the police to maintain order.  Not only did these experiences fail to produce mass hysteria, they didn't even trigger much individual psychosis.  As the Blitz progressed, psychiatric hospitals around the country saw admissions go *down*. "Chronic neurotics of peacetime now drive ambulances".  Another doctor ventured to suggest that some people actually did *better* during wartime.

"When people are actively engaged in a cause their lives have more purpose…with a resulting improvement in mental health".  Peolpe will feel better psychologically if they have more involvement with their community.

The more the Allies bombed, the more defiant the German population became.  The cities with the highest morale were the ones—like Dresden—that were bombed the hardest.

Modern society hase gravely disrupted the social bonds that have always characterized the human experience, and disasters thrust people back into a more ancient, organic way of relating.  Individuals are assessed simply by what they are willing to do for the group.  *Brotherhood of pain.*

As soon as relief flights began delivering aid to the area, class divisions returned and the sense of brotherhood disappeared.

Humans are so strongly wired to help one another—and enjoy such enormous social benefits from doing so—that people regularly risk their lives for complete strangers.  Men perfom the vast majority of bystander rescues, but women are more likely than men to display something called moral courage.  

Early leaders tended to lack empathy and emotional control, that they were not as concerned with the opinions of others.  The leaders during [the second] period were entirely focused on group morale and used skills that were diametrically opposed to those of the men who had led the escape attempts.  Without exception, men who were leaders in the one period were almost completely inactive in the other.

She couldn't figure out how to share [the single egg] with her friends, so she decided to use the egg to make pancakes so everyone could have some.  **We didn't learn the lesson of the war, which is how important it to share everything you have with human beings close to you.**

The beauty and tragedy of the modern world is that it eliminates many situations that require people to demonstrate a commitment to the collective good.  **What would you risk dying for—an for whom—is perhaps the most profound question a person can ask themselves.**  The vast majority of people in modern society are able to pass their entire lives without having to answer that question.

## in bitter safety I awake

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is more an issue with reintegrating into society than it is with witnessesing and traumatic event.  Being understood and truly valued by the society a soldier returns to significantly mitigates the effects of PTSD.  Modern society is not good at that and is incredibly disspiriting.

For some reason everything seemed like a threat.  From an evolutionary perspective, [short-term PTSD is] exactly the response you want to have when your life is in danger.  It may be unpleasant but it's preferable to getting killed.  It was like I became part of some larger human experience that was utterly heartbreaking.

Peacetime leaders, called sachems, were often chosen by women and had complete authority of civil affairs of the tribe until war broke out.  At that point war leaders took over, and their sole concern was with the physical survival of the trieb.  They were not concerned with justice or harmony or fairness, they were concerned only with defeating the enemy.  If the energy tried to negotiate an end to hostilities, however, it was the sachems, not the war leaders, who made the final decision.  Radically divergent priorities that a socity must have during peacetime and war.

The entire society was undergoing wartime trauma, so it was a collective experience—an therefore an easier one.

The trauma of combat is interwoven with other, positive experiences that become difficult to separate from the harm.  Killing an enemy soldier, or even witnessing one getting killed, was more distressing than being wounded themselves.

Strong emotional bonds within the company or platoon—and high unit cohesion is correlated with lower rates of psychiatric breakdown.

The problem doesn't seem to be trauma on the battlefield so much as reentry into society.  Recovery from war—from any trauma—is heavily influenced by the society one belongs to.  Modern society does not seem to be one that makes the process relatively easy.  **Exactly what about modern society is so morally dispiriting to come home to?**  

The individualized lifestyles that [modern] technologies spawn seem to be deeply brutalizing to the human spirit.  "You'll have to be prepared to say we are not a good society—that we are an *antihuman* society". Our society is alienating, technical, cold and mystifying.  

As awkward as it is to say, part of the trauma of war seems to be giving it up.  Adversity often leads people to depend more on each other.  One of the most noticable things about life in the military, even in support units, is that you are almost never alone.  We always felt safe because we were in a group.

Lack of social support has been found to be twice as reliable at predicting PTSD as the severity of the trauma itself.  Social cohesion is an even better predictor of trauma recovery than the level of resiliance of the person himself.  There needs to be a context for their losses and their sacrifice that is acknowledged by most of the society.  Cohesive and egalitarian tribal societies do a very good job at mitigating the effects of trauma.

Anyone who *does* suffer those things is deemed extraordinarily unfortunate, which creates an identity of victimhood that can delay recovery.  Ex-combatants shouldn't be seen—or be encouraged to see themselves—as victims.  In the United States we valorize our vets with words and posters and signs, but we don't give them what really important to Americans, we don't give them jobs.  Veterans need to feel that they're just as necessary and productive back in society as they were on the battlefield.  **All the praise in the world doesn't mean anything if your not recognized by society as someone who can contribute valuable labor.**

## calling home from mars

Acting in a tribal way simply means being willing to make a substantial sacrifice for your community.  It may be worth considering whether middle-class American life---for all it's material good fortune---has lost some essential sense of unity that we had in more tribal times that has lessened quality of life significantly.

How long do you have to know someone before you have to back them up in a bar fight?

How very close the energy of male conflict and male closeness can be.

"I'd rather have an enemy than another close friend".

There are many costs to modern society, but the most dangerous loss may be to community.  The definition of community—or tribe—would be the group of people that you would both help feed and help defend.  A society that doesn't offer its members the chance to act selflessly in these ways isn't a society in the tribal sense of the word.

The fundamental lack of connectedness allows people to act in trivial but incredibly selfish ways.

You can defend against external enemies but still remain vulnerable to the one lone madman in your midst.  It may be worth considering wehther middle-class American life—for all its material good fortune—has lost some essential sense of unity that might otherwise discourage alienated men from turning apocalyptically violent.

As loathsome and crazy as war was—it was still thought to impart wisdom nothing else could.

In all cultures, ceremonies are designed to communicate the experience of one group of people to the wider community.  Modern society rarely gives anyone opportunities to vent their feelings.

Although [veterans] are willing to die for their country, they're not sure how to live for it.  It's hard to know how to live for a country that regulary tears itself apart at every ethnic and demographic boundary.  The dismal realization that we basically live in a society at war with itself.

The eternal argument over so-called entitlement programs—and, more broadly, over liberal and conservative thought—will never be resolved because each side represents an ancient and absolutely essential component of our evolutionary past.

"Why are you focusing on how different you are from one another, and not on the things that unite us?"

Acting in a tribal way simple means being willing to make a substantive sacrifice for your community—be that your neighborhood, your workplace, or your entire country.

**He clearly understood that belonging to society requires sacrifice, and that sacrifice gives back way more than it costs.  "It was better when it was really bad".**
