# The Inevitable

Processes--the engines of flux--are now more important than products.  Our greatest invention in the past 200 years was not a particular gadget or tool but the invention of the scientific process itself.

In this era of "becoming," everyone becomes a newbie.  Worse, we will be newbies forever.  This should make us humble.

Unceasing change can blind us to its incremental changes.  In constant motion we no longer notice motion.

Right now, today, in 2016 is the best time to start up.  There has never been a better day in the whole history of the world to invent something.  __You are not late.__

## Cognifying

The entrepreneurs didn't need to invent electricity; they bought it from the grid and used it to automate the previously manual.  Now everything formerly electrified we will cognify.  Business plans for the next 10,000 startups are easy to forecast.  _Take X and add AI._

Robust intelligence may be a liability--especially if by "intelligence" we mean our particular self-awareness, and our frantic loops of introspection and messy currents of self-consciousness.

We don't know what the full taxonomy of intelligence is right now.

Our most important mechanical inventions are not machines that do what humans do better, but machines that can do things we can't do at all.  Our most important thinking machines will not be machines that can think what we think faster, better, but those that think what we can't think.

We may need to invent intermediate intelligences that can help us design yet more rarefied intelligences that we could not design alone.

The bulk of new tasks created by automation are tasks only other automation can handle.  

We can't see these jobs from here, because we can't yet see the machines and technologies that will make them possible.  Success will go to those who best optimize the process of working with bots and machines.

This is a race _with_ the machines.  You'll be paid in the future based on how well you work with robots.

Possession is not as important as it once was.  Accessing is more important than ever.

Real sustainable economic growth does not stem from new resources but from existing resources that are rearranged to make them more valuable.

Quotation symbols make it easier to indicate where one has borrowed text from another writer.  We don't have a parallel notation in film yet, but we need one.

"I consider the pixel data in images and video to be the dark matter of the internet."

While "presence" will sell it, VR's enduring benefits spring from its interactivity.

The urinal in the men's room was smarter than his computer because it knew he was there and would flush when he left, while his computer had no ideas he was sitting in front of it all day.

The future of technology resides, in the large part, in the discover of new interactions.  In the coming 30 years, anything that is not intensely interactive will be considered broken.

This small-town coveillance worked because it was symmetrical.

The usual tools for managing big data don't work very well in this territory.  A statistical prediction technique such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) breaks down because in the realm of zillionics the maximum likely estimate becomes improbable.  Navigating zillions of bits, in real time, will require entire new fields of mathematics, completely new categories of software algorithms.

To exploit the full potential of the zillionbytes of data that we are harvesting and creating, we need to be able to arrange bits in ways that machines and artificial intelligences can understand.

__Entirely new industries have sprung up in the last two decades based on the idea of unbundling.__

Wikipedia works because it turns out that, with the right tools, it is easier to restore damaged text (the revert function on Wikipedia) than to create damaged text (vandalism).  _effort asymmetries between do vs undo, create vs consume, etc... how are they changing?_

In the age of instant global connectivity, my certainty about anything has decreased.  Rather than receiving truth from an authority, I am reduced to assembling my own certainty through the liquid stream of facts flowing through the web.

I can no longer tell when I am working and when I am playing online.

I've noticed a different approach to my thinking now thata the hive mind has spread it extremely wide and loose.  My thinking is more active, less contemplative.  Rather than begin with a question or hunch by ruminating aimlessly in my mind, nourished only by my ignorance, I start doing things.  I immediately _go_.  I go looking, searching, asking, questioning, reacting, leaping in, constructing notes, bookmarks, a trail.  I act on ideas first now instead of thinking on them.

Don't confuse this flux for the shallows.  My attention has grown.

In reality you are spending 10 hours a day paying attention to one intangible thing.  _I think that's complete bullshit_

Yet the paradox of science is every answer breeds 2 new questions.  Abundant answers simply generate more questions.

In fact, it's a safe bet that we have not asked our biggest questions yet.

Answers become cheap and questions become valuable--the inverse of the situation now.  Questioning is simply more powerful than answering.

- A good question is not concerned with a correct answer.
- A good question cannot be be answered immediately.
- A good question challenges existing answers.
- A good question is on you badly want answered once you hear it, but had no inkling you care about it before it was asked.
- A good question creates new territory of thinking.
- A good question reframes its own answers.
- A good question is the seed of innovation in science, technology, art, politics and business.
- A good question is a probe, a what-if scenario.
- A good question skirts on the edge of what is known and what is not known, neither silly nor obvious.
- A good question cannot be predicted.
- A good question will be the sign of an educated mind.
- A good question is one that generates many other good questions.
- A good question may be the last job a machine will learn to do.
- A good question is what humans are for.
