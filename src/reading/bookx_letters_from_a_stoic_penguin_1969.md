### Letters From a Stoic

Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well ordered mind than a manâ€™s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company

Think for a long time whether or not you should admit a given person to your friendship. But when you have decided to do so, welcome him heart and soul, and speak as unreservedly with him as you would with yourself

Finding wealth an intolerable burden is the mark of an unstable mind.

Thus it is that foresight, the greatest blessing humanity has been given, is transformed into a curse. Wild animals run from the dangers they actually see, and once they have escaped them worry no more. We however are tormented alike by what is past and what is to come.

When a mind is impressionable and has none too firm a hold on what is right, it must be rescued from the crowd: it is so easy for it to go over to the majority

Retire into yourself as much as you can. Associate with people who are likely to improve you. Welcome those whom you are capable of improving
