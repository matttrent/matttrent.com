### Introduction

He worked with levity and played with gravity; he never acknowledged a distinction between the two. His genius lay above all in the quality of the puzzles he set for himself

### 2. Ann Arbor

master’s student and assistant on the differential analyzer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology—was tailor-made for a young man who could find equal joy in equations and construction, thinking and building

### 5. A Decidedly Unconventional Type of Youngster

For an abstracted man at his most content, the world isn’t there to be used, but to be played with, manipulated by hand and mind

### 7. The Labs

look, what you’re doing might not be important for ten years or twenty years, but that’s fine, we’ll be there then.

### 8. Princeton

“A kind of guilt or depression worms inside of you, and you begin to worry about not getting any ideas. . . . You’re not in contact with the experimental guys. You don’t have to think how to answer questions from the students. Nothing!”

### 15. From Intelligence to Information

To choose is to kill off alternatives

### 16. The Bomb

What does information really measure? It measures the uncertainty we overcome

But in his insistence on this point, he ran up against a human habit much older than him: our tendency to reimagine the universe in the image of our tools

### 21. TMI

Seldom do more than a few of nature’s secrets give way at one time

### 23. The Man-Machines

Curiosity in extremis runs the risk of becoming dilettantism, a tendency to sample everything and finish nothing. But Shannon’s curiosity was different. His kind meant asking a question and then constructing—usually, with his hands—a plausible answer

What other people called hobbies, he thought of as experiments: exercises in the practice of simplification, models that filed a problem down to its barest interesting form

The fascination of watching Shannon’s innocent rat negotiate its maze does not derive from any obvious similarity between the machine and a real rat; they are, in fact, rather dissimilar. The mechanics, however, is strikingly similar to the notions held by certain learning theorists about rats and about organisms in general

### 25. Constructive Dissatisfaction

You might, he said, start by simplifying: “Almost every problem that you come across is befuddled with all kinds of extraneous data of one sort or another; and if you can bring this problem down into the main issues, you can see more clearly what you’re trying to do.” Of course, simplification is an art form in itself: it requires a knack for excising everything from a problem except what makes it interesting, a nose for the distinction between accident and essence worthy of a scholastic philosopher. From the standpoint of Shannon’s information theory, for instance, the difference between a radio and a gene is merely accidental, and yet the difference between a weighted and an unweighted coin carries essential weight.
Failing this difficult work of simplifying, or supplementing it, you might attempt step two: encircle your problem with existing answers to similar questions, and then deduce what it is that the answers have in common—in fact, if you’re a true expert, “your mental matrix will be filled with P’s and S’s,” a vocabulary of questions already answered. Call it ingenious incrementalism—or, as Shannon put it, “It seems to be much easier to make two small jumps than the one big jump in any kind of mental thinking.”
If you cannot simplify or solve via similarities, try to restate the question: “Change the words. Change the viewpoint. . . . Break loose from certain mental blocks which are holding you in certain ways of looking at a problem.” Avoid “ruts of mental thinking.” In other words, don’t become trapped by the sunk cost, the work you’ve already put in. There’s a reason, after all, why “someone who is quite green to a problem” will sometimes solve it on their first attempt: they are unconstrained by the biases that build up over time.
Fourth, mathematicians have generally found that one of the most powerful ways of changing the viewpoint is through the “structural analysis of a problem”—that is, through breaking an overwhelming problem into small pieces. “Many proofs in mathematics have been actually found by extremely roundabout processes,” Shannon pointed out. “A man starts to prove this theorem and he finds that he wanders all over the map. He starts off and proves a good many results which don’t seem to be leading anywhere and then eventually ends up by the back door on the solution of the given problem.” Fifth, problems that can’t be analyzed might still be inverted. If you can’t use your premises to prove your conclusion, just imagine that the conclusion is already true and see what happens—try proving the premises instead

Finally, once you’ve found your S, by one of these methods or by any other, take time to see how far it will stretch. The math that holds true on the smallest levels often, it turns out, holds true on the largest. “The typical mathematical theory is developed . . . to prove a very isolated, special result, [a] particular theorem. Someone always will come along and start generalizing it.” So why not do it yourself?

### 26. Professor Shannon

But at a certain point, with all these pieces stripped out, we both saw how to solve it. And then we gradually put all these little assumptions back in and then, suddenly, we saw the solution to the whole problem. And that was just the way he worked. He would find the simplest example of something and then he would somehow sort out why that worked and why that was the right way of looking at it.

### 27. Inside Information

But money created markets and math puzzles, problems that could be analyzed and interpreted and played out. Shannon cared less about what money could buy than about the interesting games that money made possible

### 32. Aftershocks

Consider him not only as a distant forefather of the digital era, but as one of the great creative generalists of the twentieth century: not solely as someone who laid the foundation of the Information Age, but as someone who trained a powerful intellect on topics of deep interest, and continued to do so beyond the point of short-term practicality.
What can we learn from that Claude Shannon?

Shannon’s body of work is a useful corrective to our era of unprecedented specialization. His work is wide-ranging in the best sense, and perhaps more than any twentieth-century intellect of comparable stature, he resists easy categorization

He was passionately curious, but also, at times, unapologetically lazy

Hamming outlines for a group of students the attributes that make for first-rate research in mathematics and other disciplines. He singles out Shannon for special mention, and notes that part of what gave Shannon’s work force was his bravery

Time and again, he pursued projects that might have caused others embarrassment, engaged questions that seemed trivial or minor, then managed to wring the breakthroughs out of them

And that is connected, we think, to the other great hallmark of Shannon’s life: the value of finding joy in work. We expect our greatest minds to bear the deepest scars; we prefer our geniuses tortured

STEM courses are the means to job security, not joy. Studying them becomes the academic equivalent of eating your vegetables—something valuable, and state sanctioned, but vaguely distasteful
