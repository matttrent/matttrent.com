## buy experiences

**People who spend more of their money on experiential purchases report significantly greater satisfaction with their lives [than those spending on material purchases].**

An ideal experience has one or more of the folowing:

- fosters social connection
- makes a memorable story
- is tightly linked with your sense of self (current or desired)
- provides a unique opportunity, eluding comparison

Moving to a larger house will increase your satisfaction with your house, but won't increase your satisfaction with your life.

A experience that is less pleasant but more memorable is almost always preferable.

>   Things that were hard to bear are sweet to remember.
>   -- Seneca

>   "Twenty years from now you will be more disapointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did."
>   -- Mark Twain

While people usually regret not having experiences, they usually do regret buying things.  You're less likely to regret purchasing something if you view it as an experience.

Satisfaction with experiential purchases tends to increase with the passage of time, while satisfaction with material purchases tends to decrease.

## make it a treat

**If abunance is the enemy of appreciation, scarcity may be our best ally.**

I spend too much of my time on moderately nice things.  I need to adopt more of a barbell strategy, where it's both more time spent eating military rations and spent eating at banquet dinners.

The more we're exposed to something, the more its impact is diminished.  

Avoid the hedonic treadmill. Knowing something won't last forever can make us appreciate it more.  Introducing a limited time window may encourage people to seize opportunities as treats.

Though we understand that enjoyment often fades over time, we don't always *apply* that knowledge when contemplating a new purchase.

You should never own a yacht; you should have a friend with a yacht.

American culture leads people to believe they should only indulge when they have a good reason for doing so.  French culture emphasizes the value of little treats—*petis plaisirs*.

Choosing cash is economically rational, sensible and defensible—but, given the value of treats, probably detrimental for happiness.  This is because you will always choose cash to maximize possibles, then probably spend it one something more utilitarian and less pleasure-enducing.

## buy time

People often sacrifice their time to save small amounts of money.

**Ask "how will this purchase change the way I use my time?"**

Think about Tuesday.  Take the time to consider what you'll be doing from morning to night this coming Tuesday.  How will this purchase affect you on Tuesday?  Be specific with the benefits of purchases.

Regardless of wether an activity is pleasant or unpleasant, people are happiest when they stay focused on it.

Research suggests that daily hassles exert a remarkable downward force on our happiness.

Don't commute.  Don't buy expensive things that require you to work more to pay for, because you'll have less time to socialize.

While comparison shopping sounds like a smart strategy, this approach can magnify minor differences between products, tempting us to pay more for features that will have no bearing on how we spend our future time.

Hourly payment can reduce individuals' willingness to engage in activities that are emotionally, but not financially, rewarding.

Thinking about time—rather than money—spurs people to engage in activities that promote well-being.

## pay now, consume later

Reap the pleasures of anticipation.

Delaying consumption can increases happiness by:

- providing an opportunity to seek out enticing details that will promote positive expectations
- making you drool over it, increasing the pleasure of the eventual consumption
- providing an opportunity to draw out the pleasure beyond the experience

Committing ahead of time also allows you to be more mindful of where you allocate your money.  You have time to plan, consider and commit to things you value, opposed to what needs it at the moment.  This is the equivalent of spending on important things vs spending on urgent things.

Vacationers exhibited a bigger happiness boost in the weeks *before* the trip, rather than in the weeks afterwards.

Delaying consumption also increases the ability to smooth over the cracks.  It provides the time to form the desired pleasant mental model of the experience, then you focus on those aspects when the time comes.

People are driven to reduce their uncertainty by finding out what's in the box.  Yet successfuly accomplishing thi goal—taking away the uncertainty—can also take away the fun.

People overvalue the present, making it difficult to appreciate the potential benefits of the delay.

Paying far enough beforehand provides emotional distance from the act of payment, and removes the transactional feeling from the experience making the result of paying seem free.  While the sensation of free can increase happiness, it also offers freedom from the feeling of sunk costs.  You don't feel like you're losing anything if it doesn't work out.

**What we owe is a bigger predictor of happiness than what we make.**

## investing in others

Rather than thinking about the different ways you can spend money on yourself to maximize your own happiness, consider investing it in others.  Pro-social spending is done right:

- when it feels like a choice
- when it connects us with others
- when it makes a clear impact

How people spent money mattered more than how much of it they got; people that spent money on others were measurably happier than those who spent money on themselves.

What is *my* personal/pro-social spending ratio?

The effect of pro-social spending is as large as overall income in predicting happiness.  Giving some away is as rewarding as getting more.

With DonorsChoose, creating links between a specific donor and a specific classroom enables an emotional connection to emerge, increasing the happiness from donating.

Just as giving away time makes us feel that we must have a lot of time to spare, giving away money makes us feel like we must have a lot of money.

## epilogue

Use as many of the approaches as possible in every purchase.

Saving money can also boost happiness, by buffering from unpleasant shocks.  I've just witnessed this with my time off work.
