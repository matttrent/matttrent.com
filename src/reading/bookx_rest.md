No longer could scientists afford to “concentrate for extended periods of time on one subject” or think deeply “in the silence of the study, confident that rivals would not disrupt their tranquil meditations

Choosing to be prolific, he contended, meant closing off the possibility of doing great work.

Advice for a Young Investigator

Knowledge (and the culture that formed through the accumulation of knowledge) required the marriage of logical and discursive methods (ratio) and contemplative practices and attitudes (intellectus). Intellectus, in turn, was enabled by leisure, which Pieper described as not just a “result of spare time” but “an attitude of non-activity, of inward calm

Knowledge wasn’t just the product of work; how hard you worked to produce it became a measure of how significant and profound the knowledge was

Anything created through contemplation (or religious revelation, or intuition) was, by definition, less impressive and trustworthy.

The whole field of intellectual activity [has been] overwhelmed by the modern ideal of work and is at the mercy of its totalitarian claims,” he wrote, while space for contemplation and leisure had been eliminated in the name of “planned diligence and ‘total labor

Such designs assume that new ideas emerge from a stochastic process of people and ideas bouncing off each other, from brainstorms and chance encounters, rather than from contemplation or deep thinking.

Major discoveries require a “vigorous concentration of mental energy” to “raise to the conscious level” connections between observations made in the laboratory and “ideas slumbering in the unconscious

One must avoid distractions like “malicious gossip” and newspapers, the “intellectual dispersion and waste of time required by social activity

In other words, it is not constant effort that delivers results but a kind of constant, patient, unhurried focus that organizes the investigator’s attention when at work and is present but watchful during periods of ease

the better-developed your DMN, other scientists have found, the better able you are to construct models of other people’s minds.

slightly, while the resting group actually dropped a bit. The jokers in the pack were the undemanding task group: they were 40 percent more creative the second time and outperformed everybody else by a wide margin. Having to do the simple task didn’t wreck their creativity; on the contrary, because it gave them the chance to do a little mind-wandering, members of the fourth group had time to subconsciously work on the AUT.

The generative and evaluative functions are thought to take place in different parts of the brain, both of which are part of the DMN. In this theory one would expect that in creative people, the generative function would have more freedom to produce ideas, and the evaluative function would be less tightly integrated into the DMN.
