### 1. Meetings Across the Tree of Life

Cephalopods are an island of mental complexity in the sea of invertebrate animals. Because our most recent common ancestor was so simple and lies so far back, cephalopods are an independent experiment in the evolution of large brains and complex behavior

### 2. A History of Animals

An example is quorum sensing. If a chemical is both produced and sensed by a particular kind of bacterium, it can be used by those bacteria to assess how many individuals of the same kind are around. By doing this, they can work out whether enough bacteria are nearby for it to be worthwhile to produce a chemical that does its job only if many cells make it at once.

The chemistry of life is an aquatic chemistry. We can get by on land only by carrying a huge amount of salt water around with us. And many of the evolutionary moves made at these early stages—those giving birth to sensing, behavior, and coordination—would have depended on the sea’s free movement of chemicals

Further, the very existence of these new entities—animal bodies—depends on those capacities for sensing and action. Sensing and signaling between organisms gives rise to sensing and signaling within them

Evolution has transformed cell-to-cell signaling from an activity in which cells simply broadcast their signals to whoever is close enough and listening into something different: an organized network

of the nervous system is to link perception with action. Brains are for the guidance of action, and the only way to “guide” action in a useful way is to link what is done to what is seen (and touched, and tasted)

How is it that we are able to act in the first place?

But doing something, if you are made of many cells, is not a trivial matter, not something that can simply be assumed

They rightly point out that it’s easy to fall into the habit of thinking of each “action” as a single unit, in which case the only problem left to solve is coordinating these acts with the senses, working out when to do X rather than Y. As organisms get bigger and can do more, that picture becomes more and more inaccurate. It ignores the problem of how an organism is able to do X or Y in the first place

the process itself may have been largely driven by a kind of evolutionary feedback, due to interactions between organisms themselves. In the Cambrian, animals became part of each other’s lives in a new way, especially through predation

The bilaterian body plan makes for mobility (walking is a very bilateral thing to do), and this body plan is friendly, it turns out, to many kinds of complex behavior. The diversification and entanglement of lives that took place in the Cambrian was mostly the work of bilaterians

In the Cambrian, each animal becomes an important part of the environment of others. This entanglement of one life in another, and its evolutionary consequences, is due to behavior and the mechanisms controlling it. From this point on, the mind evolved in response to other minds.

only three of the major animal groups produced some species with complex active bodies (CABs). Those groups are arthropods, chordates (animals like us with a nerve cord down their back), and one group of mollusks, the cephalopods

As they see it, nervous systems originated twice. But they don’t mean that they evolved in two kinds of animals; rather, they originated twice in the same animals, at different places in the animal’s body

### 3. Mischief and Craft

Vertebrate brains all have a common architecture. When vertebrate brains are compared to octopus brains, all bets—or rather, all mappings—are off. There is no part-by-part correspondence between the parts of their brains and ours

For at least some of them, taking the lamp down from above the tank and hauling it back to the den—that is more interesting. So is squirting the experimenters

These nervous systems are more distributed, less centralized, than ours. Invertebrates’ neurons are often collected into many ganglia, little knots that are spread through the body and connected to each other. The ganglia can be arranged in pairs, linked by connectors that run along the body and across it, like lines of latitude and longitude.

Some behavioral studies gave the impression that octopuses did not even track where their own arms might be

One central idea is that our body itself, rather than our brain, is responsible for some of the “smartness” with which we handle the world. Our body’s own structure encodes some information about the environment and how we must deal with it, so not all this information needs to be stored in the brain

### 4. From White Noise to Consciousness

Do bees really remember what has happened? These are not questions that have good yes-or-no answers. There’s a smooth transition from minimal kinds of sensitivity to the world to more elaborate kinds, and no reason to think in terms of sharp divides.

But when we take an evolutionary and gradualist perspective, this takes us to strange places. How can the fact of life feeling like something slowly creep into being? How can an animal be halfway to having it feel like something to be that animal

For all organisms there is a distinction between self and the external world, even if only onlookers can see it. All organisms also affect the world outside them, whether they register

Another path in the evolution of experience leads to integration. As streams of information come in from different senses, they are brought together into a single picture. This is vivid in our own case; we experience the world in a way that ties together what we see with what we hear and touch. Our experience is usually of a unified scene.
This might seen inevitable, a consequence of having eyes and ears attached to the same brain, but it is not

A variety of species appear to be more reactive to predators seen on the left side of their visual field. Several kinds of fish, and even tadpoles, seem to prefer to position themselves so that an image of another individual of the same species is on their left side. On the other hand, various animals are better at perceiving what’s on their right side when the aim is to detect food.

To some degree, unity is inevitable in a living agent: an animal is a whole, a physical object keeping itself alive. But in other ways, unity is optional, an achievement, an invention. Bringing experience together—even the deliverances of the two eyes—is something that evolution may or may not do.

A simple interpretation of these cases holds that you need the ventral stream to have any experience of what’s coming in through your eyes at all. That is probably too simple. It’s likely that dorsal stream vision feels like something, though it doesn’t feel much like seeing

So what did these rewired frogs “see”? There is no sensible answer to this. The question only makes sense if you believe that the brain has a single visual representation of the outside world that governs all of an animal’s behavior. Ingle’s experiments reveal that this cannot possibly be true.

The senses can do their basic work, and actions can be produced, with all this happening “in silence” as far as the organism’s experience is concerned. Then, at some stage in evolution, extra capacities appear that do give rise to subjective experience: the sensory streams are brought together, an “internal model” of the world arises, and there’s a recognition of time and self.

there’s a particular style of processing—one that we use to deal especially with time, sequences, and novelty—that brings with it conscious awareness, while a lot of other quite complex activities do not

For an octopus, its arms are partly self—they can be directed and used to manipulate things. But from the central brain’s perspective, they are partly non-self too, partly agents of their own.

In the octopus’s case there is a conductor, the central brain. But the players it conducts are jazz players, inclined to improvisation, who will accept only so much direction. Or perhaps they are players who receive only rough, general instructions from the conductor, who trusts them to play something that works

### 5. Making Colors

Suppose that by changing its colors a cephalopod affects the light that reaches sensors within its skin. Then some of these ongoing low-level color changes might be a way of surveying the chromatic environment

### 6. Our Minds and Others

With an efference copy mechanism, as you decide to act, sending a “command” of some sort to your muscles, you also send a faint image of the same command (a “copy” of it, in a rough sense of that term) to the part of the brain that deals with visual input. This enables that part to take into account what your own motions are doing.

If things don’t look as expected, that might be because something in the environment has changed, but it might also be because the action you tried to perform did not come out as planned. You often need to work

For Dehaene and Naccache, the function of conscious thought is to make it possible for us to do novel, deliberate actions that require us to take the “big picture” into account.

Inner speech does not live in a little box in your brain; inner speech is a way your brain creates a loop, intertwining the construction of thoughts and the reception of them

Perhaps the most vivid of all forms of conscious thought are those in which we bring attention to bear on our own thought processes, reflect on them, and experience them as our own

When you write something for yourself to read, there’s usually an essential role for time—the goal is memory

### 7. Experience Compressed

What is the point of building a large nervous system if your life is over in a year or two?

Everyone will carry some of these mutations. Then if some lucky individual evades its predators and other natural dangers and lives for an unusually long time, it will eventually find things starting to go wrong in its body, as the effects of these mutations kick in. It will appear to have been “programmed to decline,” because the effects of those lurking mutations will appear on a schedule. The population has begun to evolve aging

Williams’s main point can be introduced by asking a simple question about saving for retirement. Is it worth saving enough money so that you will live in luxury when you are 120?

### 8. Octopolis

the earlier date makes it much more likely that cephalopods evolved complex nervous systems at least twice, once in the lineage leading to octopuses and once in the lineage leading to cuttlefish and squid.

Your memory of your last birthday is an episodic memory; your memory of how to swim is a procedural memory, and your memory of the location of France is a semantic memory

The mind evolved in the sea. Water made it possible
