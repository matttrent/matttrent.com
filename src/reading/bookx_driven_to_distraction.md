## insight and education

1. Choose a coach. It is useful for you to have a coach or some person near to you to keep after you, but always with humor. Your coach can help you get organized, stay on task, give you encouragement, or remind you to get back to work. Friend, colleague, or therapist (it is possible, but risky, for your coach to be your spouse), a coach is someone who stays on you to get things done, exhorts you as coaches do, keeps tabs on you, and in general stands in your corner. A coach can be tremendously helpful in treating ADD.
2. Seek encouragement. ADD adults need lots of encouragement. This is in part due to many self-doubts that have accumulated over the years. But it goes beyond that. More than most people, ADD adults wither without encouragement and thrive when given it. They will often work for another person in a way they won’t work for themselves. This is not “bad,” it just is. It should be recognized and taken advantage of.
3. Give up guilt over high-stimulus-seeking behavior. Understand that you are drawn to intense stimuli. Try to choose them wisely, rather than brooding over the “bad” ones.
4. Listen to feedback from trusted others. Adults (and children, too) with ADD are notoriously poor self-observers. They use a lot of what can appear to be denial.
5. Try to get rid of the negativity that may have infested your system if you have lived for years without knowing that what you had was ADD. A good psychotherapist may help in this regard.
6. Don’t feel chained to conventional careers or conventional ways of coping. Give yourself permission to be yourself. Give up trying to be the person you always thought you should be—the model student or the organized executive, for example—and let yourself be who you are.

##  performance management

1. Establish external structure. Structure is the hallmark of the nonpharmacological treatment of the ADD child. It can be equally useful with adults. Once in place, structure works like the walls of the bobsled slide, keeping the speedball sled from careening off the track. Make frequent use of lists, notes to self, color coding, rituals, reminders, files. Also use pattern planning, as described earlier.
2. Use pizzazz. Try to make your environment as peppy as you want it to be without letting it boil over. If your organization system can be stimulating (imagine that!), instead of boring, then you will be more likely to follow it. For example, in setting things up, try color coding. Mentioned above, color coding deserves emphasis. Many people with ADD are visually oriented. Take advantage of this by making things memorable with color: files, memoranda, texts, schedules, etc. Virtually anything in the black-and-white of type can be made more memorable, arresting, and therefore attention-getting with color.
3. When it comes to paperwork, use the principle of O.H.I.O: Only Handle It Once. When you receive a document or a memo or any kind of written material, try to only handle it once. Either respond to it right away, on the spot, or throw the document away, or file it permanently. Do not put it in a TO DO box or pile. For people with ADD, TO DO piles might just as well be called NEVER DONE piles. They serve as little menaces around one’s desk or room, silently building guilt, anxiety, and resentment, as well as taking up a lot of space. Get in the habit of acting immediately on your paperwork. Make the wrenching decision to throw something away. Or, overcome inertia and respond to it on the spot. Whatever you do with the document, whenever possible, only handle it once.
4. Acknowledge and anticipate the inevitable collapse of X percent of projects undertaken, relationships entered into, obligations incurred. Better that you anticipate these “failures” rather than be surprised by them and brood over them. Think of them as part of the cost of doing business.
5. Embrace challenges. ADD people thrive with many challenges. As long as you know they won’t all pan out, as long as you don’t get too perfectionistic and fussy, you’ll get a lot done and stay out of trouble. Far better that you be too busy than not busy enough. As the old saying goes, if you want to get something done, ask a busy person.
6. Make deadlines.
7. Break down large tasks into small ones. Attach deadlines to the small parts. Then, like magic, the large task will get done. This is one of the simplest and most powerful of all structuring devices. Often a large task will feel overwhelming to the person with ADD. The mere thought of trying to perform the task makes one turn away. On the other hand, if the large task is broken down into small parts, each component may feel quite manageable. (For example, it was only by using this technique that we managed to write this book.)
8. Prioritize rather than procrastinate. If you cannot handle it only once (tip 16), then be sure to prioritize. When things get busy, the adult ADD person loses perspective: paying an unpaid parking ticket can feel as pressing as putting out the fire that just got started in the wastebasket. Sometimes one becomes paralyzed. Prioritize. Take a deep breath. Put first things first. Then go on to the second and the third task. Don’t stop. Procrastination is one of the hallmarks of adult ADD. You have to really discipline yourself to watch out for it and avoid it.
9. Leave time between engagements to gather your thoughts. Transitions are difficult for ADDers, and minibreaks can help ease the transition.

## mood management

1. Have structured “blow-out” time. Set aside some time in every week for just letting go. Whatever you like to do—blasting yourself with loud music, taking a trip to the racetrack, having a feast—pick some kind of activity from time to time where you can let loose in a safe way.
2. Choose “good,” helpful addictions, such as exercise. Many adults with ADD have an addictive or compulsive personality such that they are always hooked on something. Try to make this something positive.
3. Recognize the following cycle, which is very common among adults with ADD:
   1. Something “startles” your psychological system, a change or transition, a disappointment or even a success. The precipitant may be quite trivial, nothing more than an everyday event.
   2. This “startle” is followed by a minipanic with a sudden loss of perspective, the world being set topsy-turvy.
   3. You try to deal with this panic by falling into a mode of obsessing and ruminating over one or another aspect of the situation. This can last for hours, days, even months.
   To break the negative obsessing, have a list of friends to call. Have a few videos that always engross you and get your mind off things. Have ready access to exercise. Have a punching bag or pillow handy if there’s extra angry energy. Rehearse a few pep talks you can give yourself, like, “You’ve been here before. These are the ADD blues. They will soon pass. You are OK.”
4. Learn how to name your feelings. Many people with ADD, particularly men, get frustrated and angry because they cannot put their feelings into words. With practice and coaching, this is a skill that can be learned.
5. Expect depression after success. People with ADD commonly complain of feeling depressed, paradoxically, after a big success. This is because the high stimulus of the chase or the challenge or the preparation is over. The deed is done. Win or lose, the adult with ADD misses the conflict, the high stimulus, and feels depressed.
6. Use “time-outs,” as with children. When you are upset or overstimulated, take a time-out. Go away. Calm down.
7. Remember that ADD usually includes a tendency to overfocus or hyperfocus at times. This hyperfocusing can be used constructively or destructively. Be aware of its destructive use: a tendency to obsess or ruminate over some imagined problem without being able to let it go.
8. Exercise vigorously and regularly. You should schedule exercise into your life and stick with it. It helps you work off excess energy and aggression in a positive way, it allows for noise reduction within the mind, it stimulates the hormonal and neurochemical system in a most therapeutic way, and it soothes and calms the body. When you add all that to the well-known health benefits of exercise, you can see how important exercise is. Make it something fun so you can stick with it over the long haul, i.e., the rest of your life. One particular form of exercise, sexual activity, is very good for ADD.

## interpersonal life

1. Schedule activities with friends. Adhere to these schedules faithfully. It is crucial for you to keep connected to other people.
2. Don’t stay too long where you aren’t understood or appreciated. Just as people with ADD gain a great deal from supportive groups, they are particularly drained and demoralized by negative groups, and they have a tendency to stay with them too long, vainly trying to make things work out, even when all the evidence shows they can’t.
3. Pay compliments. Notice other people. In general, get social training if you’re having trouble getting along with people.
4. Set social deadlines. Without deadlines and dates your social life can atrophy. Just as you will be helped by structuring your business week, so, too, you will benefit from keeping your social calendar organized. This will help you stay in touch with friends and get the kind of social support you need.
