## Recently finished

I have a lot of free time in the last few months, so this list is much longer than it would normally be.

- __Arnold Bennett,__ [How to Live on 24 Hours a Day](http://amzn.to/2iH06dz).  A short essay on how not to waste your life.  If Seneca's _On the Shortness of Life_ is the strategy, this is one flavor of tactics.
- __Charles Mann,__ [1491](http://amzn.to/2iGYuQW).  The New World as it actually was.  Contrary to what is taught in school, Columbus did not land in a sparsely settled, near-pristine wilderness and instead encountered a continent populated by advanced civilizations.
- __John Vaillant,__ [The Tiger](http://amzn.to/2i9Z50A).  Tiger in Russia turns man-eater.  Combo special ops/animal warden team hunts tiger.  Tiger hunts them.  Insanity that is Russia.  Man vs. alpha preditor.
- __Tim Ferriss,__ [Tools of Titans](http://amzn.to/2ia7rW8).  Agree or disagrees Ferriss' priorities, he's excellent at distilling things down into actionable life-hacks.  This is his most wide-reaching book yet.  Lots of things to apply to your life.
- __Ryan Avent,__ [The Wealth of Humans](http://amzn.to/2hv0kXw).  How does technological progress alter the relationship of Labor and Capital.  What does the future look like when there isn't enough work for the members of society?  I can't tell whether the book was superficial or I simply didn't understand it.
- __Daron Acemoglu & James Robinson,__ [Why Nations Fail](http://amzn.to/2ig8UIE).  Extractive political and economic institutions that maintain advantage for the minority elite are largely responsible for why nations fail to develop economically.
- __Steward Brand,__ [How Buildings Learn](http://amzn.to/2igd1UL).  Got distracted half way through, but still got a lot out of it.  I've always considered architecture and software development to have interesting parallels and this reinforced that idea.  Biggest insight: certain buildings being like blue jeans where they improve with use and wear.  Many things that interest me share that concept.
- __Mortimer Adler & Charles Van Doren,__ [How to Read a Book](http://amzn.to/2inkioh).  How-to guide for reading books.  While seemingly obvious, most of us were not taught the skills necessary for digesting difficult reading material.  This book presents a 4-level approach for understanding great books.  Ironically, I didn't finish it.
- __Christian Rudder,__ [Dataclysm](http://amzn.to/2hy15kg).  A study of how of human behavior on social networks.  How do people think and act towards their fellow members of society when no ones looking.  Many of the problems that came to light in 2016 have been around for a long time.
- __Reid Hoffman,__ [The Alliance](http://amzn.to/2iGJ8fk).  Thoughts on the nature of modern employer-employee relationships.  Some takeaways for me, much of it for managers.  Might have been better as a longform blog post.
- __Mark Manson,__ [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck](http://amzn.to/2iGL1Jg).  Didn't grab me much.  I'd rather read [Seneca][Letters from a Stoic] or [Marcus][Meditations] again.
- __Steward Brand,__ [Whole Earth Discipline](http://amzn.to/2igfDSM).  Argues that many of the things (nuclear power, GMO crops, etc...) viewed as ecological disasters have been exagerated, and may be necessary to avoid the larger ecological disaster of climate change.  If you're interested in climate change, this is your map.
- __John Steele Gordon,__ [An Empire of Wealth](http://amzn.to/2iGIeDA).  A telling of the history of the United States through the lens of economics.  Role of central banks and markets.  Ability of the government to raise funds to wage war.  I really enjoyed this read.
- __Brad Stone,__ [The Everything Store](http://amzn.to/2i9Zbpd).  The story of Jeff Bezos and Amazon.  If you're at all interested in the expansion of Tech beyond purely digital pursuits, this book has many lessons.
- __B. H. Liddell Hart,__ [Sherman: Soldier, Realist, American](http://amzn.to/2ia0TH5).  Biography of William Tecumseh Sherman, his life and his Civil War campaign that defined much of modern warfare.  I had no idea how bold the march to Savannah really was.
- __Chuck Yaeger,__ [Yaeger: An Autobiography](http://amzn.to/2iGFSEU).  One of a number of military biographies I read this year.  The best US fighter pilot there was and first man to break the sound barrier.
- __Steven Pressfield,__ [Gates of Fire](http://amzn.to/2iGCslH).  Fictional, yeh highly accurate, recounting of the battle of the Spartans and the battle of Thermopylae.  I could barely put it down.
- __Kai Bird & Martin Sherwin,__ [American Prometheus](http://amzn.to/2iGIFKq).  The life of Robert Oppenheimer, Los Alamos and the development of the atomic bomb and his subsequent pursecution during the Red Scare.
- __Alfred Lansing,__ [Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage](http://amzn.to/2ia4m8p).  The story of Shackleton's famed Antarctic expedition.  Despite his boat being destroyed and being trapped for 18 months, managed to get the entire crew home safely.  Perhaps one of the best studies of the quality of leadership. 
- __Rob Goodman & Jimmy Soni,__ [Rome's Last Citizen](http://amzn.to/2iGSxna).  Biography of Marcus Cato the Younger, enemy of both Caesar and Pompey.  One of the few men to fight for the idea of the Republic to the very end against dictators to the very end, choosing suicide over submission.
- __Michael Lewis,__ [Moneyball](http://amzn.to/2hy3BqB).  Someone uses data to overturn conventional wisdom and wins big.  Classic data scientist read.  Also useful for explaining what I do to regular people.
- __Walter Isaacson,__ [Benjamin Franklin: An American Life](http://amzn.to/2iGY1hL).  Fantastic portrait into one of our country's founders (especially the first &#8532;rds).  Franklin is quite the character and put a lot of thought into designing his life that's as applicable today as it was in the 18th century.
- __Walter Isaacson,__ [Einstein: His Life and Universe](http://amzn.to/2hy8HDe).  Sadly, not as good as Franklin.  Not because Isaacson wrote a poor book, but Einstein's life wasn't particulary interesting after general relativity.
- __Oliver Burkeman,__ [The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking](http://amzn.to/2iH2X6n).  I generally don't include subtitles here and I generally don't read much modern pop-philosophy.  This book is an exception.  It does a fantastic job of weaving many of my philosophical influences into one thread.
- __Carl Anderson,__ [Creating a Data-Driven Organization](http://amzn.to/2hA5XVW).  Good conceptual framework for the steps required to make data and data science effective at a company.

## All time most influential

If I were to recommend a short list of books, they'd focus on helping one get their life priorities straight.  With that in place, there's plenty of time to read on every other topic.  As such, there's a strong philosophical theme.

- __Seneca,__ [Letters from a Stoic][].  Letters from Seneca to his friend, Lucilius, on the thoughts an actions one should consider to lead a good life.  The human condition hasn't changed much in the last 2000 years and the problems the Romans faced are the same as we contend with today.  If you replace the names, these could be contemporary letters{{#sidenote "seneca"}}If this resonates with you, I'd highly recommend the full collection of his [Letters on Ethics][].{{/sidenote}}.
- __Marcus Aurelius,__ [Meditations][].  Similar to the previous, the personal journal of the one true philosopher-king to have ever ruled.  Marcus Aurelius is the most powerful man in the world and still reminds himself to practice patience and prepare to meet adversity with acceptance.  He could have literally any desire granted and reminds himself of his duty.  Reading his thoughts really puts your own life and "struggles" in a different light.
- __George Vaillant,__ [Triumphs of Experience](http://amzn.to/2iGQzU6).  The book of the Harvard Grant Study, the greatest longitudinal study ever conducted, following men from university through the rest of their lives.  While many books discuss what our elder's think is most important, this book quantifiably studies what leads to flourishing later in life.  Author's summary: "Happiness is love.  Full stop."

[Letters from a Stoic]: http://amzn.to/2iGW7O3
[Meditations]: http://amzn.to/2iGAuBI
[Letters on Ethics]: http://amzn.to/2iafj9X

Books that have significantly influenced me, in no particular order:

- __Nassim Taleb,__ [Antifragile](http://amzn.to/2iGZ9Cc).  Culmination of Taleb's thesis spanning Fooled by Randomness and the Black Swan.  Exploring the concept of things that are not only robust to chaos, but actually thrive in it, across all spheres of life.  Also, I love how cranky he is.  I could listen to him yell at kids to get off his lawn all day.
- __Cal Newport,__ [So Good They Can't Ignore You](http://amzn.to/2iH0lW7). Refuting the advice to "follow your passion", Cal deconstructs the best approach to building a meaningful career.  He proceeds to thoroughly map out an approach to define your professional life on your own terms, and gain the credibility to obtain it.  Quite possibel the best career book I've ever read.
- __Wade Davis,__ [One River](http://amzn.to/2iGPMlR).  Biography of Richard Evans Schultes, one of the most celebrated ethnobotanists to ever live, written by his protege.  Recounts his exploration of the Brazilian rainforest, weaving the stories of him, the people he meets, the plants, and the history of the land into one narrative.  
- __Eiji Yoshikawa,__ [Musashi](http://amzn.to/2iHcDxO).  Historical fiction of the life of Miyamoto Musashi, the most renowned Japanese swordsman who ever lived.  A ronin's journey through Edo Period Japan for perfection of his art and purification of spirit. This novel reads much like Gone with the Wind, but with more people fighting with swords.
- __Chris Kresser,__ [The Paleo Cure](http://amzn.to/2id3nUS).  I've read a lot of books on the paleo diet and associated lifestyle.  This is far and away the best one, focusing how to use it theraputically.  It provides a clear conceptual framework on how to remove potentially irritating foods, then test whether you can tolerate them or not.  Then moves on to the other lifestyle modifications that can improve one's health.  The one book on diet I recommend to people.

## Abridged archive

A selection of things that I have read not so recently.

- __Ryan Holiday,__ [The Daily Stoic](http://amzn.to/2iiGjlJ).  Daily Stoicism reader.  It's on my bedside table, but I haven't opened it as much as I think I should.
- __Steven Pressfield,__ [The Warrior Ethos](http://amzn.to/2hyalF8).  I'm a big fan of Pressfield's writing and the mentality of doing one's duty.  This book scratches both those itches.
- __Kevin Kelly,__ [The Inevitable](http://amzn.to/2iJFQIh).  Founding editor of Wired discusses future trends in consumer Internet technology.  Kelly presents a fascinating view of the technological future, better framing things I had thought of and introducing many new ideas.  My main complaint is that it's an overly rosy picture that doesn't really consider societal impact of many of these changes.
- __Edward Slingerland,__ [Trying Not to Try](http://amzn.to/2icWa7s). Ancient Chinese philosophy meets modern cognition.  Reframes the role of Kahneman's System 1 and System 2 in the constellation of Daoist with insights on how to make it applicable to your life.
- __Tyler Cowen,__ [Average Is Over](http://amzn.to/2icOTEQ).  Followup to _The Great Stagnation_ detailing the ongoing bifurcation of American society into the haves and the have-nots.  Economic forces will progressively reduce the middle class that has dominated the 20th century.
- __Ryan Holiday,__ [Ego Is the Enemy](http://amzn.to/2iJwEUj).  Another modern Stoicism book.  Holiday continues the Stoic tradition of distilling things to a series of life-hacks.  Love it, hate it, but if works, use it.
- __Steven Pressfield,__ [The War of Art](http://amzn.to/2htJIvZ).  Modern-day Marcus Aurelius reminding you to show up and do your assigned work professionally, as difficult as it may be.
- __Oliver Sacks,__ [On the Move](http://amzn.to/2iJLbzm).  Endearing autobiography.  I've always loved Sacks.  It was encouraging to read that someone I respect still felt he had no idea what he was doing at the age of 40.
- __Jean Edward Smith,__ [Eisenhower in War and Peace](http://amzn.to/2hxchw0).  I bought it for the perspective on the European theater, but was equally interested in his presidency.
- __Michael Lewis,__ [Flash Boys](http://amzn.to/2icKcLe).  The dark and dirty world of high-frequency trading.  This is absolutely nuts.
- __Tyler Cowen,__ [The Great Stagnation](http://amzn.to/2imHjaW).  We've run out of the major contributors to the last century of American growth.  The future will continue at the same pace.
- __Mason Currey,__ [Daily Rituals: How Artists Work](http://amzn.to/2iKm9QD). Delightful little book recounting the daily rituals and working habits of many artists.  A wonderful diversity of approaches.  My only regret is he didn't include more scientists and thinkers.
- __Daniel Kahneman,__ [Thinking, Fast and Slow](http://amzn.to/2hxgmjI).  Summary of Kahnemann's research career into cognitive biases.  Got distracted after the first section.  While I think the book is right in broad strokes, I don't think we understand the brain well enough to consider the specifics gospel.
<!-- - __John Vaillant,__ [The Golden Spruce](http://amzn.to/2iJXRtY).  Man cuts down golden-needled tree on Haida Gwaii.  I mostly enjoyed it for the description of the British Columbian coastal wilderness. -->
<!-- - __Winifred Gallagher,__ [Rapt: Attention and the Focused Life](http://amzn.to/2iiJh9Y).  Author is diagnosed cancer, realizes her life is improved by living more in the present.  Sadly this book is mostly pop-psychology and doesn't introspect much how attention improved her life. -->
<!-- - __Pedro Domingos,__ [The Master Algorithm](The Master Algorithm).  Summary of the major approaches to machine learning that turns into an ad for the author's research.  A few insights. -->
<!-- - __Donald Barlett,__ [Howard Hughes: His Life and Madness](http://amzn.to/2ivcDBM).  For as much as Hughes is a household name, I was surprised how little I knew about his life.  Hughes was a complete nut. -->
