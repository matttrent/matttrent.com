<section>
<p>I'm a scientist, <a href="https://github.com/matttrent">engineer</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/matttrent">photographer</a> and motorcyclist â€” though not necessarily in that order.</p>
<p>I'm fascinated with the process by which our minds create the world we experience and how psychology and philosophy can impact our lives.</p>
<p>I'm a <a href="http://sprig.com">culinary data scientist</a>. I spend my days studying how customers interact with the menu of a large <nobr>on-demand</nobr> restaurant. I think solving hard computer science problems can help people eat less crap food.</p>
<p>Once upon a time<label for="sn-cv" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-cv" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Many more interesting facts are found in my <a href="/attachments/work/cv.pdf">CV</a>.</span>, I was an academic researching human visual perception, including how image appearance <a href="/scale-dependent-perception">changes with size</a> and how perception of brightness &amp; contrast influence the <a href="/photometric-processing">design of monitors</a>. I have been an engineer, working at <a href="http://adobe.com">Adobe</a> on photography apps such as <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/fix.html">Photoshop Fix</a>, and at <a href="http://dolby.com">Dolby</a> on the <a href="http://www.dolby.com/us/en/brands/dolby-vision.html">Vision</a> line of high-end displays.</p>
<p>I'm a minimalist and a vaggabond at heart. Some of my happiest times have been living out of a backpack. I crave movement.</p>
<p>San Francisco is where I'm most often found. Prior to there, home has been Vancouver, Pittsburgh, Washington DC and miscellaneous other places.</p>
<p>At other times I've been a cyclist, martial artist, powerlifter and health nut. I may be again some day. I'm a pretty damn good cook.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <h3><a href='http://sergeykarayev.com/recognizing-image-style/'>Recognizing Image Style</a></h3>
  <p><span class="marginnote"><img src="{{ attachments_prefix }}/recognizing_styles_bw.png" alt="image styles" class="project"></span>The style of an image plays a significant role in how it is viewed.  We predict the style of images, and perform a thorough evaluation of different image features for these tasks. Features learned in a multi-layer network generally perform best -- even when trained for a different task.
  </p>
  <h3><a href='https://github.com/matttrent/pydata-nyc-2013'>Image Features in Python</a></h3>
  <p><span class="marginnote"><img src="{{ attachments_prefix }}/moto_keypoints_bw.jpg" alt="image features" class="project"></span>Effective machine learning combines the right algorithm with features that accurately capture the interesting aspects of the data.  At PyData, I presented ways to extract features from images using Python tools that can be readily used by developers familiar classification and clustering algorithms.
  </p>
  <h3><a href='http://www.pocketpixels.com/ColorSplash.html'>Color Splash</a></h3>
  <p><span class="marginnote"><img src="{{ attachments_prefix }}/colorsplash_bw_short.jpeg" alt="color splash" class="project"></span>Top-selling selective desaturation photography for iPhone and iPad.  Working with Pocket Pixels, I redesigned the app's graphics framework.  Based on GPU acceleration, the latest version includes interactive image adjustments and faster performance.  After release, the app rose to #6 in the US store.
  </p>
  <h3><a href='/scale-dependent-perception'>Scale-dependent perception of images</a></h3>
  <p><span class="marginnote"><img src="{{ attachments_prefix }}/chuckclose_bw_short.png" alt="chuck close" class="project"></span>My doctoral research examined ways in which perception of images changes when they are viewed at different sizes.  Due to the organization of the visual system, the appearance of blurred and sharpened edges depends on the width of the edge.  Besides the study, we propose several methods to address the change.</p>
  <h3><a href='/photometric-processing'>High dynamic range displays</a></h3>
  <p><span class="marginnote"><img src="{{ attachments_prefix }}/dr37p_bw.jpg" alt="DR37-P" class="project"></span>My early academic career was dedicated to the development of HDR displays, possessing greater contrast and brightness than conventional monitors.  Besides being of academic interest, I also played a role in the startup comercializing the technology, BrightSide Technologies, and later at Dolby.
