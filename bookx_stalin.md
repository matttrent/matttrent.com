### 2. Childhood Riddles

Little Soso learned, and never forgot, the power of a steady gaze and the terror felt by a man who does not dare to look away

But the expectation was that for the sake of that bright future the majority of the population must be exterminated. Otherwise, because of its backwardness, it would only hinder entry into the socialist paradise

### 4. Enigmatic Koba

Theirs was a country of age-old submissiveness. In Russia it was necessary only to seize power—and society would submit

But it didn’t take him long to get used to prison. “ ‘We learn, bit by bit, we learn.’ Joseph Vissarionovich liked repeating those words. With his soft accent and his light laugh

He assumed the proud name of Bolshevik (“majority man”

It can be explained only by the requirement of the Revolutionary’s Catechism that “comrades are to be valued only in accordance with their usefulness to the cause.” If Lenin could overlook such utterances, Koba must have been needed by “the cause.” Very much needed. He must in fact have distinguished himself in some important way.

Archivist: But you didn’t ask your victims first?

He: That’s a pretty bourgeois way of thinking. Still, I suppose it’s difficult to understand nowadays. The revolutionaries are all dead, and the bourgeois are still with us. Thermidor has conquered.

### 7. The Great Utopia

What nonsense! How can you carry out a revolution without shooting people

### 8. The Crisis Manager

The bandits lying beside the track forced their way onto the train, seized the money, and, obeying what was then the general rule, held a political meeting. Fiery speeches were delivered among the corpses and the burning railcars

there was no crime, it meant that the common man lived in a state of constant Kafkaesque dread, a feeling that, confronted with authority, he had no rights. This was the ultimate meaning of the Terror. And Koba took the lesson to heart

This was another lesson for Koba: you can forgive your enemy, but you must destroy him first

statements by the Party’s leaders were only the product of tactical considerations, whereas the real, long-term plans, the Party’s strategy, had to remain hidden, to be revealed at some future time

We have conjured up the devil of the market,” warned Trotsky.

### 11. The End of the October Leaders

Like many others born in Russia, they suffered from the peculiarly Russian disease of naive romanticism. They believed that the three of them had only to appear together and the Party would immediately remember the heroic past and fall in behind its former leaders

### 12. The Country at Breaking Point

Stalin left an amusing inscription on the flyleaf: “(1) weakness (2) laziness (3) stupidity are the only things that can be called vices. All else, in the absence of the above-mentioned, is virtue

NEP and a free peasantry spelled the doom of Bolshevik power. A single day without terror was dangerous; two days without terror meant death to the Party

From April 1929 the turnaround was official. The Year of the Great Turn had begun. The greatest experiment of the twentieth century, which promised endless bloodshed. But what did blood matter, when ahead of them lay the great future? Stalin meant to attain it by revolutionary means, in the shortest possible time

Menzhinsky knew the rule: you can forgive your enemy, but you must destroy him beforehand

Later on he designed a costume for the proletariat which no tailor could make. Then he put on a play based on a poem by Khlebnikov, which no one could understand. Then he designed a flying machine which, needless to say, would not fly. As he saw it, art’s only duty was to set the agenda for technology. All he did was done for the future

### 17. The Fall of “The Party’s Favorite”

Like Bukharin before them, they had lost their voices. Everybody wanted to earn the right to live. It was no time for principles

### 19. Night Life

Theremin and his work had remained in the Boss’s excellent memory, and he was quickly transferred from a normal prison camp to a sharashka. This was one of the Boss’s most impressive inventions: a closed research institute in which imprisoned scientists could continue their work

I am young. The secret of Dr. Faustus is simple: old age hides when you are working.” And he promised to live at least to a hundred

### 21. Toward the Great Dream

An empire was rising on the grave of the old Party. An atheist empire, without a god, but with a Boss.

### 23. The First Days of War

The first culprit had been identified. Stalin, says Chadayev, went on to say, “We must order them to evacuate the population and the enterprises eastward. Nothing must fall into the hands of the enemy

So Stalin emulated his teacher: Ivan the Terrible’s favorite trick was to pretend that he was dying, watch how the hapless boyars behaved, then rise from his sickbed and cruelly punish them, to discourage all the others

Intrigue was forbidden to everyone except himself

### 24. Onward to Victory

Churchill had in a way done Stalin a favor in leaving him to fight alone. With support from the Allies in weapons and food supplies his army acquired fantastic strength as it fought. Hitler’s generals and Europe’s strongest army were its teachers. By the end of 1943 Stalin had the greatest military machine that had ever existed, and Hitler’s fate was sealed

### 25. The Leader’s Plan

It meant life or death to the Great Dream. He had been frantically trying to catch up in the nuclear race for some time. He had started very late, but, as always, he was determined to catch up with a single bound.

Stalin liked to repeat that “Russians have always been good at making war, but never good at winning the peace

### 27. The Apocalypse That Never Was

On her rare visits she was alarmed to see strange pictures on the walls. He had taken to cutting out illustrations from magazines and pinning them up. Pictures of children—a little girl giving milk to an elk calf, a boy on skis, children under a cherry tree. The pictures were substitutes for grandchildren
