# How to Be a Stoic

By Massimo Pigliucci

## My notes <a name="my_notes_dont_delete"></a>

### Stoic principles:

1. **Virtue is the highest good, and everything else is indifferent.** The Stoics got the first part from Socrates, who argued that virtue is the chief good because it is the only thing that is valuable under all circumstances and that helps us make proper use of things like health, wealth, and education. Everything else is indifferent in the specifically Stoic sense that nothing is to be traded against virtue. The Stoic can pursue the preferred indifferents and try to stay away from the dispreferred ones, so long as doing so doesn’t interfere with virtue. In modern economic theory, this well-known approach is called a system of lexicographic preferences. To illustrate, you have a lexicographic preference if you wouldn’t trade your daughter for a Lamborghini, no matter how much you’d love to have a Lamborghini.
2. **Follow nature.** That is, apply reason to social life. The Stoics thought that we should take a hint from how the universe is put together in figuring out how to live our lives. Since human beings are naturally social animals capable of reason, it follows that we should strive to apply reason to achieve a better society.
3. **Dichotomy of control.** Some things are under our control, and others are not (though we may be able to influence them). If we are sufficiently healthy mentally, our decisions and behaviors are under our control. Outside of our control is everything else. We should concern ourselves with what is under our control and handle everything else with equanimity.

### Stoic virtues:

- **(Practical) wisdom:** Navigating complex situations in the best available fashion
- **Courage:** Doing the right thing, both physically and morally, under all circumstances
- **Justice:** Treating every human being—regardless of his or her stature in life—with fairness and kindness
- **Temperance:** Exercising moderation and self-control in all spheres of life

### The 12 exercises:

1. **Examine your impressions.**  Ask whether whatever is being thrown at us is under our control (in which case we should act on it) or isn’t (in which case we should regard it as not of our concern).
2. **Remind yourself of the impermanence of things.**  Care and appreciate very much what we now have, precisely because Fate may snatch it from us.
3. **The reserve clause.** Not to confuse one’s aspirations, even well-grounded ones, with how the universe will (or ought to) act is one of the hallmarks of a wise person.
4. **How can I use virtue here and now?** Every occasion, every challenge, as a way to exercise our virtue, to become a better human being by constant application.
5. **Pause and take a deep breath.** If someone succeeds in provoking you, realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation.
6. **Other-ize.** What makes us think that we are the universe’s special darlings, or that we ought to be?
7. **Speak little and well.** Let silence be your goal for the most part; say only what is necessary, and be brief about it.
8. **Choose your company well.** Avoid fraternizing with non-philosophers. If you must, though, be careful not to sink to their level.
9. **Respond to insults with humor.** An insult works, not because it is intended as such by the person who delivers it, but because the target allows it to become an insult.
10. **Don’t speak too much about yourself.** Just because you enjoy recounting your exploits doesn’t mean that others derive the same pleasure from hearing about them.”
11. **Speak without judging.** Distinguish between matters of fact—to which we can assent if we find them justified by observation—and judgments, from which we generally ought to abstain.
12. **Reflect on your day.** What bad habit of yours have you cured to-day? What vice have you checked? In what respect are you better?

## additional notes

In order to live a good life, we:

- must understand the nature of the world and our place on it
- must understand the nature of human reasonn (and its many failures)

Make the best use of what is in your power and take the rest as it happens.  Some things are up to us and some are not.

Live in accordance with nature. Nature is ethical, so we must develop ethics. Man is social so we must extend those ethics to our fellows.

You are free to seek pleasure and avoid pain as long as you don't compromise your virtue. Acquire them if you can but a eudaimonic life does not require them.

A higher order to the universe makes very little difference in what is require to live a eudaimonic life.

Virtue is a wholesale package; you either posses it or don't.  Wisdom, temperance, courage and justice are interrelated and common across all societies.

Amathia, more the failure of intelligence than lack of intelligence, is responsible for negative actions.  And is more spiritual sickness than ignorance.

Stoicism is not about suppressing or hiding emotion—rather, it is about acknowledging our emotions, reflecting on what causes them, and redirecting them for our own good

Einstein’s god”: the simple, indubitable fact that Nature is understandable by reason

it began in the guise of, and has always been understood as, a quest for a happy and meaningful life

Seneca connected this test to the rest of our existence on earth: “A man cannot live well if he knows not how to die well.”

Another compelling account of Stoicism is provided by Vice Admiral James Stockdale in his memoir In Love and War.

A philosophy of life is something we all need, however, and something we all develop, consciously or not.

the Stoics turned out to be overly optimistic about how much control human beings have over their own thoughts

The goal is to learn something about how to answer that most fundamental question: How ought we to live our lives?

That framework is the idea that in order to live a good (in the sense of eudaimonic) life, one has to understand two things: the nature of the world (and by extension, one’s place in it) and the nature of human reasoning (including when it fails, as it so often does).


The discipline of desire (also referred to as Stoic acceptance) tells us what is and is not proper to want.

Two of the four Stoic virtues are pertinent to regulating desire: courage (to face facts and act accordingly) and temperance (to rein in our desires and make them commensurate with what is achievable). The discipline of action (known also as Stoic philanthropy, in the sense of concern for others) tells us how to behave in the world. It is the result of a proper understanding of ethics, the study of how to live our lives, and it draws on the virtue of justice. Finally, the discipline of assent (or Stoic mindfulness) tells us how to react to situations, in the sense of either giving our assent to our initial impressions of a situation or withdrawing it. This discipline is arrived at via the study of logic—what is and is not reasonable to think—and requires the virtue of practical wisdom.

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
And wisdom to know the difference.

 “Make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens. Some things are up to us and some things are not up to us.

One of Epictetus’s crucial points is that we have a strange tendency to worry about, and concentrate our energies on, precisely those things we cannot control.

The Stoics perfected this idea of ethical development and called it oikeiôsis, which is often translated as “familiarization with” or “appropriation of” other people’s concerns as if they were our own. 

The ball is only a means to an end and isn’t the important thing—it is what one does with the ball that defines the game, how well it is played, and who wins or loses.

Stoics occupy the logical space in between these two positions: health, wealth, education, and good looks—among other things—are preferred indifferents, while their opposites—and a number of other things—are dispreferred indifferents

Although all of these qualities are indifferent to your ability to pursue a virtuous life—to become a morally worthy person—they are still preferred (just as any normal human being would readily tell you) so long as they don’t get in the way of your practice of the virtues.

it appears that much of our diverging metaphysics makes little difference to what we think is important in life, or to how we behave toward others.

what is important in life is to live it well, and that such an objective—the eudaimonic existence sought by the ancients—depends very little on whether there is a God or not

The reason why wisdom is the “chief good,” according to Socrates, is rather simple: it is the only human ability that is good under every and all circumstances.

The Stoics adopted Socrates’s classification of four aspects of virtue, which they thought of as four tightly interlinked character traits: (practical) wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice. Practical wisdom allows us to make decisions that improve our eudaimonia, the (ethically) good life. Courage can be physical, but more broadly refers to the moral aspect—for instance, the ability to act well under challenging circumstances, as Priscus and Malala did. Temperance makes it possible for us to control our desires and actions so that we don’t yield to excesses. Justice, for Socrates and the Stoics, refers not to an abstract theory of how society should be run, but rather to the practice of treating other human beings with dignity and fairness.

Courage: Emotional strengths that involve the exercise of will to accomplish goals in the face of opposition, external or internal; examples include bravery, perseverance, and authenticity (honesty).
Justice: Civic strengths that underlie healthy community life; examples include fairness, leadership, and citizenship or teamwork.
Humanity: Interpersonal strengths that involve “tending and befriending” others; examples include love and kindness.
Temperance: Strengths that protect against excess; examples include forgiveness, humility, prudence, and self-control.
Wisdom: Cognitive strengths that entail the acquisition and use of knowledge; examples include creativity, curiosity, judgment, and perspective (providing counsel to others).
Transcendence: Strengths that forge connections to the larger universe and thereby provide meaning; examples include gratitude, hope, and spirituality.


human societies that have developed philosophies of life have repeatedly come up with remarkably similar lists of what we call virtues.

“intelligent stupidity” was not “so much lack of intelligence as failure of intelligence, for the reason that it presumes to accomplishments to which it has no right.” Intelligent stupidity “is no mental illness, yet it is most lethal; a dangerous disease of the mind that endangers life itself.” The danger lies “not in an inability to understand but in a refusal to understand, [and] any healing or reversal of it will not occur through rational argumentation, through a greater accumulation of data and knowledge, or through experiencing new and different feelings.” Instead, intelligent stupidity is a “spiritual sickness,” and in need of a spiritual cure.

So amathia seems to be a crucial word missing from the English vocabulary. It is the opposite of wisdom, a kind of dis-knowledge of how to deal with other human beings,

Distilled to their bare minimum (in order to derive the most benefit from these spiritual exercises), the Stoic principles are as follows:
1. Virtue is the highest good, and everything else is indifferent. The Stoics got the first part from Socrates, who argued that virtue is the chief good because it is the only thing that is valuable under all circumstances and that helps us make proper use of things like health, wealth, and education. Everything else is indifferent in the specifically Stoic sense that nothing is to be traded against virtue. The Stoic can pursue the preferred indifferents and try to stay away from the dispreferred ones, so long as doing so doesn’t interfere with virtue. In modern economic theory, this well-known approach is called a system of lexicographic preferences. To illustrate, you have a lexicographic preference if you wouldn’t trade your daughter for a Lamborghini, no matter how much you’d love to have a Lamborghini.
2. Follow nature. That is, apply reason to social life. The Stoics thought that we should take a hint from how the universe is put together in figuring out how to live our lives. Since human beings are naturally social animals capable of reason, it follows that we should strive to apply reason to achieve a better society.
3. Dichotomy of control. Some things are under our control, and others are not (though we may be able to influence them). If we are sufficiently healthy mentally, our decisions and behaviors are under our control. Outside of our control is everything else. We should concern ourselves with what is under our control and handle everything else with equanimity.

Moreover, while engaging in the exercises proposed here, remember that they are supposed to further your mastery of the four Stoic virtues:
(Practical) wisdom: Navigating complex situations in the best available fashion
Courage: Doing the right thing, both physically and morally, under all circumstances
Justice: Treating every human being—regardless of his or her stature in life—with fairness and kindness
Temperance: Exercising moderation and self-control in all spheres of life


1. Examine your impressions

constantly examine our “impressions”—that is, our initial reactions to events, people, and what we are being told—by stepping back to make room for rational deliberation, avoiding rash emotional reactions, and asking whether whatever is being thrown at us is under our control (in which case we should act on it) or isn’t (in which case we should regard it as not of our concern).

2. Remind yourself of the impermanence of things

we should constantly remind ourselves of just how precious our loved ones are precisely because they may soon be gone. 

care and appreciate very much what we now have, precisely because Fate may snatch it from us 

3. The reserve clause

keep my will in line with nature—which is impossible if I go all to pieces whenever anything bad happens.’

we may set out with a particular goal in mind but that events may not go the way we wish. That being the case, our choices are to make ourselves miserable, thereby willfully worsening our situation, or to remember our overarching goal: to be a decent person who doesn’t do anything that is unvirtuous or that may compromise our integrity (like behaving obnoxiously in reaction to another’s obnoxious behavior).

e need to make our goal something that actually is in our power and not even Fate can rob us of

Rather, it is to deploy the wisdom that sometimes things will not go our way even if we do our best, and regardless of whether we deserved to win the match or get the promotion. Not to confuse one’s aspirations, even well-grounded ones, with how the universe will (or ought to) act is one of the hallmarks of a wise person.

4. How can I use virtue here and now?

e every occasion, every challenge, as a way to exercise our virtue, to become a better human being by constant application.

5. Pause and take a deep breath.

If someone succeeds in provoking you, realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation

 we must pause, take a deep breath, perhaps go for a walk around the block, and only then consider the issue as dispassionately (in the sense of equanimity, not lack of care) as possible.

6. Other-ize.

What makes us think that we are the universe’s special darlings, or that we ought to be?

they are in the normal order of things. The universe isn’t after anyone—or at least, it isn’t after any one of us in particular!

7. Speak little and well. “Let silence be your goal for the most part; say only what is necessary, and be brief about it.

Above all don’t gossip about people, praising, blaming or comparing them.

the general Stoic principle that we can decide on our best course of action and then redirect our behavior accordingly.

8. Choose your company well. “Avoid fraternizing with non-philosophers. If you must, though, be careful not to sink to their level

strive to be a philosopher in this sense of the term—that is, to apply reason to improve his own and his community’s life and well-being.

engaging in less and more meaningful conversation

truly pay attention to whom I spend my time with and why

we want to be with friends who are better than ourselves, so that we can learn from them

9. Respond to insults with humor. “If you learn that someone is speaking ill of you, don’t try to defend yourself against the rumors; respond instead with, ‘Yes, and he doesn’t know the half of it, because he could have said more.’”

an insult works, not because it is intended as such by the person who delivers it, but because the target allows it to become an insult.

There is no reason at all why insults, even when meant as such, cannot also be teaching moments for us.

10. Don’t speak too much about yourself.

Just because you enjoy recounting your exploits doesn’t mean that others derive the same pleasure from hearing about them.”

11. Speak without judging.

e idea is to distinguish between matters of fact—to which we can assent if we find them justified by observation—and judgments, from which we generally ought to abstain

12. Reflect on your day.

How have I erred, what done or left undone? So start, and so review your acts, and then for vile deeds chide yourself, for good be glad.

What bad habit of yours have you cured to-day? What vice have you checked? In what respect are you better?
