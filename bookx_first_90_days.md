# bookx first 90 days

## 1. Promote yourself

- often fail to "promote yourself" by taking the necessary change in perspective

- think about what you want to accomplish in the first:
- day / week / month / 3 months

- assess your vulnerabilities
- "everyone has an urge to work one level below where they are"
- pinpoint vulnerabitilies through problem preferences
- what kinds of problems to you naturally gravitate towards
- compensate for vulnerabilities through: discipline/team-building/advice and counsel
- qualities that made you successful so far can be weaknesses in new role

### checklist

1. how will you orient yourself to the business, identify and connect with key stakholders, clarify expectations and adapt to a new culture?
2. what made you successful so far in your career?  What are the critical sklls you need to develop?
3. are there aspects of your new job that are critical to success but you prefer not to focus on?
4. from who might you seek advice and counsel on?

## 2. Accelerate your learning

- few leaders take the time to systematically think about their learning priorities
- fewer still explicitly create a learning plan when entering a new role

ask 5 questions to ask other people:

1. What are the biggest challenges the organization is facing?
2. Why is the organization facing these challenges?
3. What are the most promising unexploited opportunities for growth?
4. What would need to happen for the organization to exploit these?
5. If you were me, what would you focus your attention on?

soon after entry

- meet one-on-one with people: (eng, growth, ops, product, culinary)
- test awareness of 
- meet with boss and discuss hypotheses and findings

by the end of the first month

- discuss observations with boss

### checklist

1. do you sometimes fall prey to the action imperative?
2. what is your learning agenda?
3. what are you hypotheses and how are you going to test them?
4. who is likely to provide you the most useful insight?
5. how might you increase your learning efficiency?
6. what support is available to accelerate your learning?

## 3. Match strategy to situation

- figure out whether you are reflexively a hero or a steward

## 4. Negotiate success

fundamentals of interacting with your boss

- don't stay away -- regularly check in
- don't surprise your boss
- don't approach your boss with only problems
- focus on only the most important things and where you could use their help
- don't expect your boss to change
- __clarify expectations early and often__
- take 100% of the responsibility in making the relationship work
- negotiate timelines for diagnosis and action planning
  - don't let yourself get caught up in firefighting or making calls before you're ready
- aim for early wins in areas important to your boss

5 conversations

1. situational diagnosis conversation
2. expectations conversation
  - what will your boss expect from you in the short & medium term
  - wah will constitute success
3. resource conversation
4. style conversation
  - how can you and your boss best interact?
5. personal development conversation
  - once you're a few months in, discuss how you're doing and development priorities

priorities

- early conversations should focus on situational diagnosis, expectations and style
- then negotiate for resources
- then introduce personal deveolpment once relationship well-established

### planning the style conversation

- determine how you and your boss can best work together
- how does your boss like to communicate? in what form? how often? regarding which decisions?
- building a positive relationship with your boss is 100% your responsibility
- focus early conversations on goals and results, not how you will achieve them

### planning expectations conversation

- agree on short- and medium-term goals and on timing
- agree how progress will be measured?
- what will constitute success?
- identify areas important important to your boss
- work to shape your boss's perceptions on what what you can and should achieve
- under-promise and over-deliver
- go back regulary and clarify -- don't let key issues be ambiguous

### planning resource conversation

- before starting, agree on situation, assocaited goals and expectations
- in a startup, most urgent needs will be financial resources, technical support and people with right expertise
- __ask yourself "what exactly do I need from my boss?"__  

### planning the personal development conversation

- delay until roughly the 90 day mark
- don't restrict your focus to hard skills

### putting it all together

- devise a plan after a few weeks at the job  
  _in my case, aim for 6 & dedicate time in next 2 weeks to broader issues_
- the plan should be written, even if a few bullet points
- plan should specify priorities, goals, milestones
- divide the 90 days into 3 blocks of 30 (a bit late for that)
- devote first block to learning and building credibility
- __set weekly goals for yourself and develop a discipline__
- 30 days: diagnosis of the situation, indentification of priorities and plan for next 30 days
- 60 days: review progress towards goals laid out 30 days ago

## 5. Secure early wins

- focus on making successive waves of change
- each wave should consist of the following phases: learning, desiging changes, building support, implementing changes and observing the results
- the goal of the first wave is to secure early wins
- second wave is to typically addresses more fundamental issues of strategy, structure, systems and skills

- don't only chase low-hanging fruit
- don't waste energy on early wins that don't contribute to achieving their longer-term objectives
- __need to both build short-term momentum and lay foundation for achieving longer-term goals__

basic principles

- focus on a few promising opportunities
- get wins that matter to your boss
- get wins in the right ways -- keep it on the up and up
- adjust for culture (probably not a big deal, I'm a good fit)
- build personal credibility for roughly the first 30 days
- then decide which projects I will launch to achieve early improvements

attributes that build credibility:

- demanding but able to be satisfied
- decisive but judicious -- make low-risk decisions early, hold off on big ones
- focused but flexible
- active without causing commotion -- push people, but watch burnout

launching early-win projects

- identify 3 areas where you will seek to achieve rapid improvement
- keep your long-term goals in mind -- _what are my long-term goals_
- identify a few areas/proceses you can dramatically improve ops/$$ performance
- leverage early-win projects to introduce new behaviors

## 6. Achieve alignment

## 7. Build your team

## 8. Create coalitions

## 9. Keep balance

3 questions

- how do you feel so far?
    - excited? confident? in-control?
- what has bothered you so far? 
    - failed to connect? what has troubled you?
- what has gone well or poorly?
    - which interactions could have gone better?  which went well?
    - which decisions turned out particularly well, or poorly?
    - what where the biggest missed opportunities?

major intereference with transition

1. __undefined boundaries__ -- people will take whatever you have to give  
   note: watch this with benji and coding, generally try and have him code
2. __brittleness__ -- sticking to decisions unnecessarily
3. __isolation__ -- spend active effort to reach out and interact with people more than necessary
4. __work avoidance__ -- you will have to get your hands dirty and make calls right away

### adopt 90-day strategies

1. prepare myself
2. accelerate my learning
3. match my strategy to the situation
4. negotiate success
5. secure early wins
6. create alliances

### develop personal disciplines

- knowing what to do is not the same as doing it
- dedicate daily and weekly time to planning
- focus on the most important work -- early in the day
- defer as much commitment as possible until you've had time to evaluate
- check in with yourself -- engage in reflection, take action from insights

### build your support systems

- assert control locally, get the minor aspects of office, routine and expectations sorted out quickly
- stabilize the home front
- __build your advice and counsel network__ -- MENTORS!
    - will your existing network provide the support you need?
    - talk to tara, and greylock people to connect with
