### Introduction The Call of Solitude

After six or seven weeks, without other people to help me maintain my identity, the facade of autonomous self-sufficiency started to crumble. Fear crept in as I awoke to how small and vulnerable I was in the face of an enormous and threatening universe

Of course the quality of the work must be excellent when you step outside the usual framework

Over and over when I’ve tried to arrange things ahead of time I’ve had to either give up or have watched my plans fall apart. But over and over, too, things have worked out at the last minute in unexpected ways. Why do I still resist living by faith? I’m seriously stressing myself and it doesn’t seem to do much good. But perhaps the last-minute miracles won’t happen if I stop the preparatory work

### February 2001

Always risky to extrapolate from what you do know to what you don’t

### March 2001

I want to explore the anxiety I so often feel. It’s deep and poisons my life. I’ve seen over and over that things work out — not always as I’d planned, sometimes much better — yet still I look ahead with fear. Instead of relaxing into life, I’m often needlessly tense and worried

Sometimes time stretches on forever, usually when there is physical, emotional, or spiritual pain, otherwise the days zoom by

The challenge, of course, is to give thanks no matter what the circumstance, but sometimes that’s not so easy to do.

Basic survival requires a competent ego, but it has usurped control and is no longer a servant/friend of my whole being — which includes spirit, intuition, and love, and finds joy and peace through relaxing into the flow of existence. The ego wants to dominate, and in order to justify its overbearing presence, it creates looming illusory problems to solve.

Anxiety is part of our human condition, and we need to learn to treat it as an old friend, or least a familiar acquaintance. Many therapists say to do something to avoid anxiety, but in such endless activity much of our experience — joyful and painful — is lost. Seems like a hard bargain

### Interlude: On Journaling and Storytelling

writing tended to pull me out of the present moment and mute the intensity of experience — unless I remained clearly aware of the actual process of writing. Remaining silent was often preferable

it was not actual journaling that became distracting, but thinking beforehand about what I would write and mentally describing to myself what I was seeing and feeling

Any story we create — if we actually believe it and take it as our own — will limit our freedom to be who we are not in that new story

whenever we find ourselves entering narcissistic territory, we can recognize the terrain without searching immediately for an alternative

Despite differences in theology, moral orientation, and self-discipline, the man in that pedestrian tale may have more in common with St. Augustine and his surrender of personal agency to Divine Will than with the stereotypical self-oriented striving of modern culture’s secular hero.

My goal in the wilderness was not to conquer either the external world or my own inner nature, but to give up the illusion of ownership and control and to experience myself as part of the ebb and flow of something greater than individual ego. But the goal of attaining enlightenment was elusive — except when it was not. Through a shift in consciousness, my quest came to an end as I realized there was nowhere to go and nothing to get

### April 2001

It isn’t actually non-doing that generates anxiety, but rather fretting about doing or not doing

I recall, as from a place and time far away and half forgotten, my grandiose intention in coming here: to explore, through living, the physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual effects of deep wilderness solitude. Now my world has shrunk to this small beach and stretch of water; to what I’ll eat for lunch; to hooking up the stove and rain barrel; to the pain in my shoulders, hands, and teeth

If I have a stake — set expectations — I’m not truly open to discovery. I must trust not only the physical process, but the emotional and spiritual ones as well

I suspect I’m keeping some strong feelings at bay by staying busy

“Where there is no joy there can be no courage; and without courage all the other virtues are useless.” Where is my joy?

And now I feel cut off, lonely, and frightened. Edging through the days and wondering if I’ll make it. I need to commit myself to stop being unhappy and to stop sounding like a broken record. Life will be what it is.

What are these lacks of color? Grey, black, and silver are not enough. A rich monochrome spectrum reaches out from that deep distance: close hills are dark and solid, and each line behind lighter in mass and tone

At Buddhist meditation retreats students are urged to sleep as little as possible to develop more continuous awareness. We often tend to escape from consciousness into sleep or into activity and substances. Here, I’m becoming clearer that there is no “away” where I can go

It’s not that thinking is bad, but it becomes addictive and will not end my suffering as I expect it to

What is this core I’m knotted around? What painful wound am I protecting? I want nothing to touch me there — but rain, wind, cold, and Cat keep battering the walls I build. It may be shame that I’m weak or cowardly and not up to this experience. I feel I’m still in spiritual hiding, crouching out of the infinite eternal flow of existence; afraid to surrender to my fear and suffering, to vulnerability and death

To call fishing a sport is like calling gardening a pastime or church a social activity. On one level all three labels are accurate, but if it’s nothing more to you, you’ve missed the heart of the matter — the place where you are no longer only you but part of something greater

### Interlude: Method, Solitude, and Meditation

We are the sum of all the observations we make. When we refuse to acknowledge certain aspects of our lived experience simply because we cannot make rational sense of them, we impoverish our lives. Self-knowledge is vital to our understanding of the world and our place in it.

### June 2001

I often find it hard to let go of what might have been and stay with what actually is

### Interlude: A Glance at Other Solitaries

Shekhdar claims to have been disappointed to not directly experience the existence of God, but how could he? He kept his mind so full of trivial activity there was little possibility to notice God’s presence

Avoidance has many forms. Commonly, when terror and loneliness wash over us and we fear being swept away, we avert our attention by keeping ourselves busy with activity or some other escape, such as reading or television, food or narcotics, or other people

Patience seems to develop with the growing realization that we are not in charge of the world

A third, and for me vital, commonality all solitaries seem to share is the experience of feeling vibrantly, often ecstatically, alive in a living world

### July 2001

An important step in learning to love him, the ducks, the trees and myself is to slow down and feel the world, rather than being so impatient to accomplish things.

I talk about the need to surrender, but the experience of feeling weak, vulnerable, and dependent brings up feelings of shame. The shame comes partly from our strong cultural ideal of autonomy and self-reliance, and partly from my own deep rebellion and pride. I don’t want to be naked and ask for acceptance just as I am. Ah, but it’s cold and lonely inside these walls.

Last night I sensed that the biological world that we lose by building a conceptual reality to buffer ourselves against uncertainty, suffering, and death is profound and meaningful

Personal myth is a real risk. We tell stories about the past and forget that these stories are our own creations, built on selected aspects of experience. The stories describe a self-identity we come to believe in: “I did this or I thought that.” Once we believe the myth we ’ve created to be literally true, we become — in our own mind — the character in the myth. Then the real problems begin. We must now live up to our expectations for this character based on what he or she has done in the past — what we have created him or her to have done. When who we actually are does not behave the way we’ve created the hero of our myth to behave, we feel like a failure

### Interlude: Dancing in the Hallowed Halls

The ultimate meaning of any experience is simply itself. There is no need to categorize or analyze. Maslow asks, “What is the meaning of a leaf, a fugue, a sunset, a flower, a person?” And he answers, “They ‘mean’ themselves, explain themselves, and prove themselves

I distinguish and wish to clump into groups that I might call cats or steamer ducks. I hold up a clear sheet of acetate in my mind and draw an outline around each of these things. This outline is the concept I (my culture) create to help organize my (our) experience. This is a useful process.
The problem develops when the acetate becomes opaque, and we can no longer see through it to the flowing Suchness beyond; when all we experience are the outlines that we, ourselves, have drawn. At this point, we ’re no longer experiencing the actuality of life, but only our own abstractions and ideas about those abstractions

Conceptual reality is necessary if we are to function in the world, but if we get stuck there and no longer feel the world directly, life loses its joy

This debate is grounded in yet another false dichotomy: that mind and matter are fundamentally different and separate. But what if the fracture is due to how we conceptualize the world? Have we, in our thinking, split apart what is essentially the unified mindmatter “stuff ” of the universe

### August 2001

Sensing the loss and trying to be good enough to get it back might be the source of my perfectionism. But trying to be perfect is not the way home

Usually we stay only a brief time in the wilderness and our disquiet doesn’t catch up with us. I’ve been here long enough that this has become my normal life, and all my usual concerns are in operation. But there are fewer distractions and escapes here, so I can see the process more clearly and must face my concerns more directly

Solitude is liberating because the only limiting factor is your own capacity, but difficult because there are no other people to help catalyze growth. In solitude you pretty much must do it on your own.

Care of the Soul

What has happened to my flow of language? I fall mute before such wonder and beauty. I try to describe the delicate shades and patterns of shifting color as wind swirls water around immovable rock, but my images feel dull and trite. There is no dance between word and world. What I see and feel begs a sensuous tango, but my words march static and stiff in lines across the page.

To truly face fear I must simply be with the experience and do nothing to avoid or attack it.

### Interlude: The Urge to Be Alone

Our language has wisely sensed the two sides of being alone. It has created the word loneliness to express the pain of being alone. And it has created the word solitude to express the glory of being alone

In Solitude: A Philosophical Encounter, Philip Koch

Koch also identifies five virtues — valued states or activities — most easily realized in solitude: Freedom, Attunement to Self, Attunement to Nature, Reflective Perspective, Creativity

Alone in the wilderness, I often feel isolated not only from others (in my mind and heart) but also from the nonhuman world around me; from Spirit; from myself. At other times, with no change in physical circumstance, I feel fully integrated into the flow of the universe, which includes not only the world immediately around me but also my web of human relationships

Not all men are called to be hermits, but all men need enough silence and solitude in their lives to enable the deep inner voice of their own true self to be heard at least occasionally.... If man is constantly exiled from his own home, locked out of his own spiritual solitude, he ceases to be a true person. He no longer lives as a man

We each have a social identity, a persona held in place by our interactions with other people. In solitude, without others to mirror this persona, it begins to lose solidity and dissolve. The process can be terrifying, and one powerful aspect of solitude is that there are few easy escapes from such difficult experiences

The ability to build a shelter, stay warm and dry, obtain and prepare food, repair clothing and damaged equipment, maintain personal health, and use a map to navigate on land or water are all necessary physical skills. It is also vital to have the psychospiritual tools and experience to deal with the mental effects of long solitude. There are various ways to do this, but most fundamental is the capacity to experience with equanimity (or to ignore) whatever arises in the mind.

### October 2001

One of the challenges of solitude is that potential or imagined danger can loom to fill the mind. Without other people to help maintain perspective, fear that would normally be manageable can overwhelm

Today is Sunday, my day of rest. All week, now and then, I look forward to Sunday.
 
I exercise just enough to ease my shoulder ache, do not meditate, reread a novel rather than philosophy or spiritual teaching, build a fire, and feel no obligation to sit outside in the rain and wind.
 
Sunday is, perhaps, my hardest day. Unstructured and undisciplined, deep aches and longings wash over me and lie as heavy as gloom on my heart.
 
On Sundays, even more than on other days, I escape into coffee, popcorn, and chocolate. I long to be elsewhere, but nowhere I can think of.

I’m also going to give up coffee, cocoa, chocolate, sugar, and bread for at least a month. I’ve become more and more aware of how I use food and caffeine to escape physical and emotional pain and to change from feeling a sort of hollow depression to feeling pretty

good

### Interlude: Technology and Desire

All technology should be assumed guilty until proven innocent.
— DAVID BROWER

Men have become the tools of their tools. ... Most of the luxuries, and many of the so called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.
— HENRY DAVID THOREAU

We have seriously confounded luxury with necessity in our culture, and can no longer differentiate between what we want in order to maintain a particular lifestyle (with its social relationships and sensual pleasures) and what we actually need for physical survival. We have confounded social identity with biological and spiritual being to the point of believing we will die if we lose our social standing, which is often based on the material wealth we have accumulated

### November 2001

Perhaps doing for the doing rather than for the result is a good thing. Why should we study nature only to share the information with others? Why not primarily for our own interest?

I’ve noticed over and over these past days that it’s words — some kinds of words — spoken to myself or read that shift me from small to Big Mind. So words themselves are not a prison, but only certain uses of them. A lot of densely packed analytic words tend to tighten my mind. A few lyrical words often open an inner space. I need to remember this in my writing and speaking — both with others and with myself.

### January 2002

My craving for answers is really a longing for security. When I let go of that need, and step into unknowing and trust, I’m much more relaxed and peaceful

Defenselessness is a question I’ve been struggling with for days. If I stop defending myself, will nature roll over me? I think the problem is seeing myself as a separate thing instead of as a process that’s an integral part of nature

### Epilogue

It’s fascinating how readily the mind creates and projects regular patterns onto the world, and how exciting it is to then “discover” those apparent patterns
