### Prologue: The General Theory of Evolution

The way that human history is taught can therefore mislead, because it places far too much emphasis on design, direction and planning, and far too little on evolution

But if there is one dominant myth about the world, one huge mistake we all make, one blind spot, it is that we all go around assuming the world is much more of a planned place than it is.

As Nassim Taleb remarks in his book Antifragile, in a complex world the very notion of ‘cause’ is suspect: ‘another reason to ignore newspapers with their constant supply of causes for things’

Our language and our thought divide the world into two kinds of things – those designed and made by people, and natural phenomena with no order or function.

These – markets, language, customs – are man-made things. But none of them is designed by a human being. They all emerged unplanned

Darwinism is the ‘special theory of evolution’; there’s a general theory of evolution too, and it applies to much more than biology

The general theory says that things do not stay the same; they change gradually but inexorably; they show ‘path dependence’; they show descent with modification; they show trial and error; they show selective persistence
