### Prologue: The General Theory of Evolution

The way that human history is taught can therefore mislead, because it places far too much emphasis on design, direction and planning, and far too little on evolution

But if there is one dominant myth about the world, one huge mistake we all make, one blind spot, it is that we all go around assuming the world is much more of a planned place than it is.

As Nassim Taleb remarks in his book Antifragile, in a complex world the very notion of ‘cause’ is suspect: ‘another reason to ignore newspapers with their constant supply of causes for things’

Our language and our thought divide the world into two kinds of things – those designed and made by people, and natural phenomena with no order or function.

These – markets, language, customs – are man-made things. But none of them is designed by a human being. They all emerged unplanned

Darwinism is the ‘special theory of evolution’; there’s a general theory of evolution too, and it applies to much more than biology

The general theory says that things do not stay the same; they change gradually but inexorably; they show ‘path dependence’; they show descent with modification; they show trial and error; they show selective persistence

### 1 The Evolution of the Universe

Again and again, we have told ourselves that there is a top–down description of the world, and a top–down prescription by which we should live

The Renaissance, the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment and the American Revolution were all inspired by people who had to some degree imbibed Lucretius

It did not matter how many skyhooks were found to be illusory, the next one was always going to prove real. Indeed, so common is the habit of suddenly seeing design, after all the hard work has been done to show that emergence is more plausible, that I shall borrow a name for it – the swerve

These assaults on determinism came from below, not above; from within, not without. If anything they made the world a still more Lucretian place. The impossibility of forecasting the position of an electron, or the weather a year ahead, made the world proof against the confidence of prognosticators and experts and planners.

### 2 The Evolution of Morality

Smith was also part of a Scottish tradition that sought cause and effect in the history of a topic: instead of asking what is the perfect Platonic ideal of a moral system, ask rather how it came about.
