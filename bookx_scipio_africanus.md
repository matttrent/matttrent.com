### CHAPTER II. - DAWN.

Scipio’s attitude, and one of the finest of military tributes to him is the abiding affection felt for him by his subordinate generals

The account shows that he was master of two more attributes of generalship—the power to keep his intentions secret until their disclosure was necessary for the execution of the plan, and the wisdom to realise that military success depends largely on the thoroughness of the previous preparation.

### CHAPTER III. - THE STORM OF CARTAGENA.

The consequence was that nothing was omitted which was necessary in the engagement, but the moment that circumstances suggested any step to him, he set to work at once to do what was necessary.”

### CHAPTER VI. - THE SUBJUGATION OF SPAIN.

Scipio’s military motto would seem to have been “ every time a new stratagem

No vengeance could improve his military or political position, now unchallenged, whereas, on the other hand, it would merely sow the seeds of future trouble, convert the survivors into embittered foes, biding their time for a fresh outbreak

### CHAPTER VII. - THE TRUE OBJECTIVE.

tactical key to victory lay in the possession of a superior mobile arm of decision—cavalry. It is not the least tribute to his genius that to appreciate this he had to break loose from the fetters of a great tradition, for Rome’s military greatness was essentially built on the power of her legionary infantry

Few generals have been so bold as Scipio when boldness was the right policy, but he was too imbued with the principle of security to strike before he had armed himself and tempered his weapon by training

### CHAPTER VIII. - A POLITICAL HITCH.

Scipio, wiser than the military authorities of 1914, understood crowd psychology, and knew that the led put the worst construction on the silence of the leaders, that they assume no news to be bad news, despite all the proverbs.

### CHAPTER IX. - AFRICA.

Their strategy foreshadowed Napoleon’s maxim that “ the whole art of war consists in a well ordered and prudent defensive, followed by a bold and rapid offensive

### CHAPTER XI. - ZAMA.

here Scipio anticipated Wellington by two thousand years in revealing the truth that the long shallow line is the formation which allows of the greatest volume of fire, which fulfils the law of economy of force by bringing into play the nre—whether bullets or javelins—of the greatest possible proportion of the force

### CHAPTER XII. - AFTER ZAMA.

In assessing the world’s great figures, other than the definitely religious, we have tended to base our estimate mainly on concrete achievement and mental calibre, overlooking the moral values —the same lack of balance between the three spheres which has been remarked in the conduct of policy in peace and war

### CHAPTER XIV. - THE LAST LAP.

Two good leaders in the same command are not a good combination

### CHAPTER XVI. - ROME’S ZENITH.

While strategy is more particularly concerned with the movement of armed masses, grand strategy, including these movements, embraces the motive forces which lie behind them, material and psychological. ... The grand strategist we see is, consequently, also a politician and a diplomatist.

Watch him, on arrival in Spain, make wide inquiries about the position of the Carthaginian forces, and the importance and topography of Cartagena. His genius tells him that here is the base and pivot of the Carthaginian power in Spain, and shows him the feasibility, the way, and the effect of such a stroke—at the moral and economic rather than the purely military objective.

Caesar’s work paved the way for the decline and fall of Roman power. Scipio’s work made possible a world community of virile States, acknowledging the overlordship of Rome, but retaining the independent internal organs necessary for the nourishment and continued life of the body politic

Scipio could administer military beatings at least as effectively and brilliantly as any other of the greater captains, but he saw beyond the beating to its object
